    <h3>
      PREPARATIONS AND PLANS.
    </h3>
    <p>
      "It will be another 'sky cruise,' longer and daintier and
      lovelier!" exclaimed Jess Bancroft, clapping her hands.
      "Peggy, you're nothing if not original."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, there are automobile tours and sailing trips, and
      driving parties&mdash;" "And railroad journeys and mountain
      tramps&mdash;" interrupted Jess, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, and there are wonderful, long-distance migrations of
      birds, so why not a cross-country flight of motor
      butterflies?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It would be splendid fun," agreed Jess eagerly; "we could
      take the <i>Golden Butterfly</i> and the <i>Red Dragon</i>
      and&mdash;&mdash;" "Don't forget that Bess Marshall has a
      small monoplane, too, now. I guess she would go in with us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a doubt of it. Let's go and find the boys and see what
      they say to it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No need to go after them, here they come now."
    </p>
    <p>
      As the golden-haired Peggy spoke, two good-looking youths
      came round the corner of the old-fashioned house at Sandy
      Bay, Long Island, where the two young Prescotts made their
      home with their maiden aunt, Miss Sally Prescott. One of the
      lads was Roy Prescott, Peggy's brother, and the other was
      Jimsy Bancroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, girls, what's up now?" inquired Roy, as both girls
      sprang to their feet, their faces flushed and eyes shining.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, nothing particular," rejoined Peggy, with assumed
      indifference, "except that we've just solved the problem of
      what to do with the rest of the summer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what's that,&mdash;lie in hammocks and indulge in
      ice-cream sodas and chocolates?" asked Jimsy mockingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, indeed, you impertinent person; the young lady of the
      twentieth century has left all that far behind her," was
      Jess's Parthian shot, "for proof I refer you to our
      adventures on the Great Alkali."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hello! what's this?" asked Roy, holding up a dainty
      cardboard box, and giving vent to a mischievous smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Chocolates!" cried Jimsy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It <i>was</i> chocolates," corrected Peggy reproachfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And yet shall be," declared Jimsy, producing from some
      mysterious place in a long auto coat another box, beribboned
      and decorated like the first.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jimsy, you're an angel!" cried both girls at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So I've been told before," responded the imperturbable
      Jimsy, "but I never really believed it till now."
    </p>
    <p>
      Peggy rewarded him for the compliment by popping a chocolate
      into his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gravely munching it, Jimsy proceeded to interrogation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And how did you solve the problem of what to do with the
      rest of the summer?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      For answer Peggy pointed to the sky, a delicate blue dome
      flecked with tiny cloudlets like cherub's wings.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By circling way up yonder in the cloudfields," she laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But that's no novelty," objected Roy, "we've been up 5,000
      feet already, and&mdash;&mdash;" "But we're talking about a
      tour through cloudland," burst out Jess, unable to retain the
      secret any longer, "a sort of Cook's tour above the earth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wow!" gasped both boys. "There's nothing slow," added Roy,
      "in that or about you two. And, incidentally, just read this
      letter I got this morning, or rather I'll read it for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying Roy produced from his coat a letter closely written
      in an old-fashioned handwriting. It was as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      "My Dear Niece and Nephew: No doubt you will be surprised to
      hear from your Uncle Jack. Possibly you will hardly recall
      him. This has, in a great measure, been his own fault as,
      since your poor father's death, I have not paid the attention
      I should to my correspondence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This letter, then, is to offer what compensation lies in my
      power for my neglect. Having read in the papers of your
      wonderful flying feats in Nevada it struck me that you and
      your young friends might like to pay me a 'flying trip,'
      making the excursion via a&euml;roplane.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are to have some flying contests in Marysville during the
      latter part of the month, and you might care to participate
      in them. Of course I expect your Aunt Sallie to accompany
      you. Hoping sincerely to see you, I am
    </p>
    <p>
      <br>
      "Your affectionate uncle,<br>
      "James Parker.<br>
      "Marysville, North Carolina."
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      As Roy concluded the reading the quartet of merry youngsters
      exchanged delighted glances. As if by magic here was an
      objective point descried for their projected motor flight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, that's what I call modern magic," declared Jimsy
      glowingly; "consider me as having accepted the invitation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Accepting likewise for me, of course," said Jess, shaking
      her black locks and blinking round, expectant eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course," struck in Peggy affectionately, "the Girl
      Aviators cannot be parted."
    </p>
    <p>
      Just at this moment came a whirring sound from high in the
      air above them. Looking up, they saw a dainty green
      monoplane, with widespread wings and whirring propeller,
      descending to earth. An instant later the machine had come to
      a halt on the lawn, alighting as lightly as wind-blown
      gossamer. In the machine was seated a pretty girl of about
      Peggy's age, though rather stouter. In harmony with the color
      of the machine she drove, the newly arrived girl aviator wore
      a green aviation costume, with a close-fitting motor bonnet.
      From the beruffled edge of this some golden strands of hair
      had escaped, and waved above two laughing blue eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hello, people!" she hailed, as the porch party hastily
      adjourned and ran to welcome her, "how's that for a novice
      only recently out of the Mineola School?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bess Marshall, you're a wonder!" cried Peggy, embracing her;
      "the <i>Dart</i> is the prettiest little machine I've seen
      for a long time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Isn't it a darling," agreed Bess warmly, "but, my! how I had
      to beg and pray dad before he would buy it for me. He said
      that no daughter of his should ever go up in an
      a&euml;roplane, much less drive one. It wasn't till I got him
      down at Mineola and persuaded him to take a ride himself that
      he consented to buying me my dear little <i>Dart</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      She laid one daintily gloved hand on the steering wheel of
      the little monoplane and patted it affectionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's pretty enough, but it wouldn't fly very far," commented
      Roy teasingly, "sort of a&euml;rial taxicab, I'd call it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that so, Mr. Roy Prescott? Well, I'd like you to know
      that the <i>Dart</i> could fly just as far and as fast as the
      <i>Red Dragon</i> or the <i>Golden Butterfly</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, if you wanted to take a trip to North Carolina with us
      you'd have an opportunity to test that idea out," laughed
      Peggy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A trip to North Carolina? What do you mean? Are you
      dreaming?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, not even day-dreaming."
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then Miss Prescott, her gentle face wreathed in smiles,
      appeared at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Children! children!" she exclaimed, "what is all this?
      Adjourn your discussion for a while and come in and have
      tea."
    </p>
    <p>
      While the happy group of young fliers are entering the
      pretty, old-fashioned house with its clustering roses and
      green-shuttered casements, let us relate a little more about
      the young personages to whose enthusiastic talk the reader
      has just listened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roy and Peggy Prescott were orphans living in the care of
      their aunt, Miss Prescott, the location of whose home on Long
      Island has already been described. At school Roy had imbibed
      the a&euml;rial fever, and after many vicissitudes had built
      a fine monoplane, the <i>Golden Butterfly</i>, with which he
      had won a big money prize, besides encountering a series of
      extraordinary a&euml;rial adventures. In these Peggy
      participated, and on more than one occasion was the means of
      materially aiding her brother out of difficulties. All this
      part of their experiences was related in the first volume of
      this series, "The Girl Aviators and the Phantom Airship."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the second volume, "The Girl Aviators on Golden Wings," a
      combination of strange circumstances took our friends out to
      the Great Alkali of the Nevada desert. Here intrigues
      concerning a hidden gold mine provided much excitement and
      peril, and the girls proved that, after all, a fellow's
      sisters can be splendid companions in fun and hardship. An
      exciting race with an express train, and the adventure of the
      "Human Coyote," provided stirring times in this story, which
      also related the queer antics of Professor Wandering William,
      an odd character indeed. Space does not permit to relate
      their previous adventures in more detail, but in "The Girl
      Aviators' Sky Cruise" still other interesting and unusual
      experiences are described,&mdash;experiences that tested both
      themselves and their machines in endurance flights.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of Roy and Peggy's devoted friends, Jess and Jimsy Bancroft,
      it is enough to say that both were children of Mr. Bancroft,
      a wealthy banker, who had a palatial summer home near to the
      Prescotts' less pretentious dwelling. Since we last met Jess
      and Jimsy their father had allowed them to purchase an
      a&euml;roplane known as the <i>White Flier</i>. It was in
      this craft that Jimsy and Roy had flown over for mail when
      they made their entrance at the beginning of this chapter. Of
      the letter they found awaiting them we already know.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jolly, good-natured Bess Marshall had taken up aviation as a
      lark. She was a typical specimen of an American girl.
      Light-hearted, wholesome and devoted to all sorts of sports,
      tennis, swimming, golf, motoring and finally aviation had, in
      turn, claimed her attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, having introduced our heroes and heroines of the sky
      to those who have not already met them, we will proceed to
      see how Miss Prescott receives the startling plans that her
      young charges are about to lay before her.

      OFF ON THE FLIGHT.
    </h3>
    <p>
      "But, my dear children, do you realize what such a trip
      means?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentle-voiced Miss Prescott leaned back in her easy-chair
      and gazed at Peggy and Roy with an approach to consternation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It means fun, adventure, and&mdash;oh, everything!" cried
      Peggy, clapping her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can't have the heart to refuse us," sighed Jess.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If it were only the boys it might be different, but two
      young ladies&mdash;" "Three," corrected Bess.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Three, then. For three young ladies, supposedly of sound
      mind, to go flying across country like, like&mdash;"
      "Butterflies," struck in Jimsy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait a minute," cried Jess, "there'd have to be four
      ladies&mdash;" "Of course; a chaperon," breathed Peggy, with
      a mischievous glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Prescott dropped her knitting.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Peggy Prescott, you mean me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course; who else could go?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear child, do you actually contemplate taking me flying
      through the air at my time of life?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not? It isn't as if you'd never been up," urged Peggy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You said you liked it, too," struck in Jess.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Um&mdash;well, I may have said so," admitted Miss Prescott,
      visibly weakening from the stand she had taken, and she went
      on: "I would like to see James again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And here is your opportunity ready to hand, as the
      advertisements say," declared Bess, her blue eyes shining.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But how could I go?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The question was an outward and visible sign of capitulation
      on Miss Prescott's part.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, I was thinking we could use that big biplane I was
      building for Mr. Bell's use out in Nevada," spoke up Roy; "it
      will seat three, and is as steady as a church, thanks to that
      balancing device Jimsy and I figured out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd fly my little <i>Dart</i>," declared Bess.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you and I would take the <i>Golden Butterfly</i>," cried
      Peggy, crossing to Jessie and placing her arm round the
      dark-haired girl's neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jimsy can fly the <i>Red Dragon</i>, and that leaves Roy and
      auntie for the biplane," she went on, bubbling over with
      enthusiasm as her plans matured and took form.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Goodness gracious, an a&euml;rial circus!" cried Miss
      Prescott. "We would attract crowds, and that wouldn't be
      pleasant."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was planning to make it a sort of picnic," declared Peggy,
      who appeared to have an answer for every objection that could
      be interposed to her project.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What, camp out every night? Well, you are a wonder,"
      exclaimed Jimsy, "if there's one thing I love it's camping
      out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How long would it take us to get to Marysville?" asked Bess.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll get the atlas," cried Peggy, "but if we have good
      weather not more than three or four days."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hardly think it would take as long as that," declared Roy,
      as five eager heads were bent over the atlas.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But camping out!" exclaimed Miss Prescott, "think of colds
      and rheumatism, not to mention snakes and robbers."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell you what," cried Jimsy suddenly, "what's the matter
      with Miss Prescott going along in an automobile? We can map
      out the route, arrange our stops and meet every evening at
      some small town where we won't attract too much of a crowd."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jimsy, I always said you were a genius," cried Peggy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Behold the last objection swept away," struck in Bess.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Surely you can't refuse now?" urged Jess.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please say yes," came from them all.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But&mdash;but who would drive the car?" asked Miss Prescott,
      in the voice of one who is thinking up a feeble last
      objection.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, Jake Rickets, of course," declared Roy, referring to
      the man who helped the boys in the machine shop in which the
      a&euml;roplanes for the desert mines were manufactured.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this Miss Prescott could make but a poor stand against
      the united urgings of five impetuous, enthusiastic young
      people. The air was filled with plans of all sorts. Jimsy was
      for going at once, but it was finally decided to meet again
      and set a definite date for a start. In the meantime there
      were parents' consents to be obtained, plans laid for the
      route to be followed, and various things purchased for the
      a&euml;rial trip.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this occupied some time, and it was not till a week later
      that the last difficulty in connection with the motor flight
      had been straightened out and the three a&euml;roplanes stood
      ready, in Roy's hangar, for a tour that was to prove eventful
      in more ways than one.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was just after dawn on the day of the start that Roy and
      Jimsy for the last time went over every nut and bolt on the
      machines and declared everything in perfect readiness for the
      trip. Breakfast was a mere pretence at a meal; excitement got
      the better of appetites that morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beside the winged machines sputtering and coughing as if
      impatient at the delay, was a large and comfortable red
      touring car. At the driver's wheel of this vehicle was seated
      a small, "under-done"-looking man, in a chauffeur's uniform
      of black leather. This was Jake Rickets.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Jake, we're all ready for a start," announced Roy, at
      last.
    </p>
    <p>
      The small man, whose hair was fair, not to say pale, glanced
      at the glowing boy with an expression of deep melancholy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, if something don't happen," he declared, in tones of
      deep pessimism.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jake's never happy unless he's foreboding some disaster,"
      explained Roy to Bess, who happened to be standing by drawing
      on her gloves.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It don't never do to be too sure," murmured the melancholy
      Jake, "'cos why? Well, you can't most generally always tell."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Everything ready?" cried Peggy at last, as Miss Prescott got
      into the car.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As ready as it ever will be," merrily called back Bess, who
      was already seated in the little green <i>Dart</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chorus of engine pantings and explosions was swelled by
      the roar of Roy's big biplane and the rattling exhaust of
      Jimsy's fierce-looking <i>Red Dragon</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Golden Butterfly</i>, which was equipped with a
      silencing device, ran smoothly and silently as a sewing
      machine. Peggy sat at the wheel, while Jess reclined on the
      padded seat placed tandemwise behind her. It made a wonderful
      picture, the big white biplane with its boy driver, the
      scarlet and silver machine of Jimsy Bancroft and the delicate
      green and gold color schemes of the other two flying
      machines.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The first stop will be Palenville," announced Roy, "the
      biplane will be the pathfinder."
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite the earliness of the hour and the efforts that had
      been made to keep the motor flight a secret, the information
      of the novel experiment had, in some way, leaked out. Quite a
      small crowd gave a loud cheer as Roy cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We're off!" cried Peggy, athrill with excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Propellers flashed in the sunlight and the next instant the
      biplane, after a short run, soared aloft toward a sky of
      cloudless, clean-swept blue. In rapid succession the <i>Dart,
      Golden Butterfly</i> and <i>Red Dragon</i> followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come on," cried Bess to Jimsy, waving her hand
      challengingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ladies first, even off the earth," came back from Jimsy
      gallantly, as he skillfully "banked" his machine in an upward
      spiral.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then upward and outward soared the gayly colored sky racers,
      like a flock of wonderful birds. It was the greatest sight
      that the crowd left behind and below had ever witnessed,
      although one or two shook their heads and prophesied dire
      results from young ladies tampering with them blamed "sky
      buggies."
    </p>
    <p>
      But not a thought of this entered the heads of the
      a&euml;rial adventurers. With sparkling eyes, and bounding
      pulses they flew steadily southward, from time to time
      glancing below at the touring car. Even though they were
      flying slowly it was plain that the big auto had hard work to
      keep up with them. The unique motor flight was on, and was
      about to develop experiences of which none of them at the
      moment dreamed.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      LITTLE WREN AND THE GIPSIES.
    </h3>
    <p>
      They flew on, keeping the motor car beneath them in constant
      sight till about noon. Then, from the tonneau of the machine,
      came the waving of a red square of silk. This had been agreed
      upon as a signal to halt for a brief lunch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shouting joyously, the young adventurers of the air began
      circling their machines about, dropping closer earthward with
      every sweep. Beneath them was a green meadow, bordered on one
      side by a country road and on the other by a small brook of
      clear water and a patch of dark woods. It was an ideal place
      to halt for a roadside lunch, and as one after the other the
      machines dropped to earth Miss Prescott was warmly
      congratulated on her choice of a halting place.
    </p>
    <p>
      The car was left in the road, and the melancholy Jake Rickets
      set to work getting wood for a fire, for it was not to be
      thought of that Miss Prescott could go without her cup of
      tea. In the meantime the girls spread a cloth and set out
      their fare. There were dainty chicken sandwiches with crisp
      lettuce leaves lurking between the thin white "wrappers,"
      cold meat and half a dozen other little picnic delicacies,
      which all the girls, despite their a&euml;rial craze, had not
      forgotten how to make.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boys set up a shout as, returning from attending to the
      a&euml;roplanes, they beheld the inviting table.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This beats camping out by ourselves," declared Roy, "girls,
      we're glad we brought you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you for the compliment," laughed Jess. "I suppose you
      mean that you are glad <i>we</i> brought all this."
    </p>
    <p>
      She waved her hand at the "spread" dramatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Both," rejoined Jimsy, throwing himself on the grass. By
      this time Jake's kettle was bubbling merrily, and soon the
      refreshing aroma of Miss Prescott's own particular kind of
      tea was in the air. The boys preferred to try the water from
      the brook, despite Jake's dire hints at typhoid and other
      germs holding a convention in it. It was sweet and cool, and
      the girls voted it as good as ice-cream soda.
    </p>
    <p>
      "At any rate as we can't get any we might as well pretend it
      is," declared Bess.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the meal passed merrily. After it had been concluded, amid
      gay chatter and fun, Peggy proposed an excursion to the woods
      for wild flowers which grew in great profusion on the
      opposite side of the stream. Crossing it by a plank bridge,
      the young people plunged into the cool woods, dark and green,
      and carpeted with flowering shrubs and vines.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some time they gathered the blossoms, and were just about
      to return to the a&euml;roplanes and resume their journey
      when Peggy uttered a sudden sharp exclamation:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hark! What's that?" she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      They all listened. Again came the sound that had arrested her
      attention; a sharp cry, as if some one was in pain or fright.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came definite words:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't! Please; don't hit me again!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a child!" exclaimed Jimsy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A girl!" cried Peggy, "some one is ill-treating her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'll soon find out!" cried Roy hotly. It infuriated the boy
      to think that a child was being subjected to ill-treatment,
      and the nature of the cries left no doubt that such was the
      case.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stand back here, girls, while we see what's up!" struck in
      Jimsy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed we'll do no such thing!" rejoined the plucky Bess,
      bridling indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "At any rate let us go in advance," advised Roy; "we don't
      know just what we may run up against."
    </p>
    <p>
      This appeared reasonable even to Bess, and with the boys
      slightly in advance the little group pressed rapidly forward.
      After traveling about two hundred yards they found themselves
      in a small clearing where a most unusual sight presented
      itself; a sight that brought a quick flash of indignation to
      the face of every one of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cowering under the blows of a tall, swarthy woman was a small
      girl, so fragile as to appear almost elfin. The woman wore
      the garb of a gipsy, and the presence of some squalid tents
      and tethered horses showed our young friends at once that it
      was a gipsy encampment upon which they had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman was so intent on belaboring the shrieking child
      that at first she did not see the newcomers. It was not till
      Roy stepped up to her, in fact, that she became aware of
      their presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you doing to this child?" demanded Roy indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's none of your business," was the retort, as the woman
      for an instant released her hold on the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instantly the little creature darted to the sheltering arms
      of Peggy, sobbing piteously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! Save me from her, she will kill me," the child cried, in
      a broken voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There! there!" soothed Peggy tenderly, "don't cry. We won't
      let her harm you any more."
    </p>
    <p>
      But like a fury the woman flew at the girls. Before she could
      lay hands on them, however, Roy and Jimsy had seized her arms
      and held them. At this the crone set up a hideous shriek and,
      as if it had been a signal, two swarthy men, with dark skins
      and big earrings in their ears, came running from behind the
      tents.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's the trouble?" they cried, as they ran up, regarding
      the boys malevolently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's the Wren; they're trying to steal the Wren!" shrilled
      out the woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this the men rushed at the boys, one of them waving a
      thick cudgel he carried.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let go of that woman," they shouted furiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another instant and the boys would have been in a bad
      position, for both the gipsies were powerful fellows, and
      appeared determined to commit violence. But Roy, releasing
      his hold of the struggling gipsy woman, put up his fists in
      such a scientific manner that, for an instant, the attack
      paused. This gave Jimsy time to rush to his side. The instant
      she was released the woman darted to the side of the men.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Beat them! Kill them!" she cried frantically.
    </p>
    <p>
      The men resumed their rush, and the next moment the boys
      found themselves fighting to escape a furious assault.
      Neither of the lads was a weakling, and good habits and
      constant athletic exercise had placed them in the pink of
      condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the two gipsies were no mean antagonists. Then, too, the
      one with the cudgel wielded it skillfully. Time and again
      Jimsy avoided a heavy blow which, if successful, must have
      injured him seriously. The girls, screaming, rushed off,
      carrying "the Wren," as the woman called her, with them. They
      dashed at top speed back to the spot where the
      a&euml;roplanes had been left, and summoned Jake.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I knew something would happen," declared that worthy, as he
      picked up a monkey wrench, the only weapon at hand, and
      started off for the woods.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girls followed him, Miss Prescott not having been
      vouchsafed anything but a most hurried explanation of what
      was going on. Just as Jake appeared on the scene Jimsy had
      received a terrific blow on the arm from one of the gipsy's
      cudgels. The boy's arm dropped as if paralyzed. With a howl
      of triumph the ruffian who had dealt him the blow rushed in
      on the injured lad. In another instant it would have looked
      bad indeed for Jimsy, but Roy, landing a hard blow against
      his assailant, hastened to his chum's rescue.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You look after that fellow. I'll take care of this one,"
      cried Jake, rushing into the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e, whirling his
      monkey wrench in a formidable manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girls, huddled in a group, gazed on in frank alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, they'll be killed!" shrilled Jess.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Roy! Roy! Be careful!" cried Peggy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I wish we could get a policeman," cried Bess, clasping
      her hands nervously. But as it happened a policeman, even if
      such a personage had been within a dozen miles, was not
      needed. A clever blow from Roy laid the cudgel wielder low,
      and the other man, not liking the look of Jake's monkey
      wrench, capitulated by taking to his heels. The woman cowered
      back among the tents.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come on, let's be going," cried Roy, as he saw that the
      battle was over.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ouch! my wrist!" exclaimed Jimsy, wringing his left hand; "I
      believe that fellow has broken it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let's have a look," said Roy, as the two boys made their way
      to the huddled group of girls.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing but a nasty whack," he pronounced, after an
      examination. "Well, girls, was it an exciting battle?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, it was terrible," cried Jess; "we thought you'd be badly
      beaten."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But as it is we appear to be future 'white hopes,' not
      forgetting Jake," smiled Roy, who was still panting from his
      exertions.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You were awfully brave, I think," cried Bess admiringly,
      giving the three "heroes" a warm glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, there wasn't anything to do but fight, unless we'd run
      away," laughed Roy, "and now what about the cause of all the
      trouble?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced at the little girl clinging to Peggy's hand. The
      child was pitifully emaciated, with drawn features and large,
      dark eyes that gazed about her bewilderedly. Her clothing was
      a red gingham dress that fitted her like a sack. She was
      shoeless and stockingless. Her brown hair, unkempt and
      ragged, hung in elf locks about her sad little face.
      Certainly, as regarded size and general appearance, her name,
      "The Wren," fitted her admirably.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know what to do about her," admitted Peggy; "suppose
      we ask Aunt Sally? I don't want to let the gipsies have her
      again, and yet I don't see how we can take her."
    </p>
    <p>
      At the words the little creature burst into a frantic
      outbreak.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't let those people have me back; don't," she begged;
      "they'll kill me if you do."
    </p>
    <p>
      She clung passionately to Peggy's dress. Tears came to the
      girl's eyes at the pitiful manifestation of fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There! there, dear," soothed Peggy, stroking the child's
      head, "you shan't go back if we can help it. Come with us for
      the time being, anyway."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But we have no legal right to take her," objected Roy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't say another word," snapped the usually gentle Peggy,
      whose indignation had been fully aroused, "come on. Let's get
      back to where we left Aunt Sally, then we can decide what to
      do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Incidentally, we'll do well to get out of this vicinity
      before any more of those fellows come up. There must be
      several more somewhere close at hand," exclaimed Jimsy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; and I'll bet the others, the two who ran off, have gone
      to call them," put in Roy; "that woman has disappeared, too."
    </p>
    <p>
      No time was lost in getting back to the a&euml;roplanes, "The
      Wren," as the gipsies called her, keeping tight hold of
      Peggy's hand. The boys walked behind and, with Jake, formed a
      sort of rear guard to ward off any possible attack. But
      either the other members of the band were far off, or else
      they did not care to attempt an assault, for the party
      reached the a&euml;roplanes without further incident or
      molestation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Prescott's consternation may be imagined as she listened
      to the tale they had to tell. From time to time during its
      relation she glanced pityingly at the Wren.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor child!" she exclaimed, gazing at the wizened little
      creature's bruised arms. They were black and blue from rough
      handling, and bore painful testimony to the life she had
      lived among the gipsies.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is your name, dear?" she asked, motioning to the child
      as Peggy finished her story.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Wren, that's what they always called me," was the
      response, in a thin little wisp of a voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you no other name?" asked Miss Prescott kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The child shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know. Perhaps I did once. I wasn't always with the
      tribe. I remember a home and my mother, but that was all so
      long ago that it isn't clear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then she's not a gipsy," declared Peggy emphatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll bet they kidnapped her some place," exclaimed Roy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That doesn't solve the problem of what to do with her,"
      struck in Jess.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We can't send her back to those people," declared Bess, with
      some warmth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "On the other hand, how are we to look after her?" said
      Jimsy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a problem that will have to solve itself," said Miss
      Prescott, after a few moments of deep thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How is that?" asked Peggy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because she goes with us no matter what happens. It may not
      be legal, but humanity comes above the law sometimes,"
      declared Miss Prescott, with emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hurrah for Aunt Sally!" cried the boys, "she's as militant
      as a newly blossomed suffragette. Cheer up, Wren, you're all
      right now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I'm to stay with you?" questioned the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course," came from Aunt Sally.
    </p>
    <p>
      The child buried her head on the kind-hearted lady's lap and
      burst into a passion of weeping that fairly shook her frail
      frame.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at this juncture that Jake set up a shout and pointed
      toward the woods. From them a group of men had burst, armed
      with sticks and stones. They came rushing straight at the
      little group, uttering ferocious shouts.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We're in for it now," exclaimed Roy; "girls, you had better
      get in the machine and drive a safe distance. Those fellows
      mean mischief."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      APPROACH OF THE STORM.
    </h3>
    <p>
      It was apparent enough that mean mischief they did. Their
      dark eyes gleamed fiercely out of their swarthy faces. One or
      two wore a vivid red or blue handkerchief knotted about
      sinewy necks, this means of adornment only adding to their
      generally sinister look.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I knew we wouldn't get far without running into trouble,"
      moaned Jake dejectedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roy turned on him sharply, almost angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You get the ladies in that machine and drive off down the
      road a bit," he said; "I'll attend to this thing. Jimsy, come
      here."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jake hesitated a moment and then strode off to the auto.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can't we stay and help?" asked Bess.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; we can help Roy best by doing what he; wants us to. He's
      got some plan in his head," rejoined Peggy firmly, "come
      along, Wren; Jess, help me with her, she's terrified to
      death."
    </p>
    <p>
      This was no exaggeration. At sight of the gipsy band, the
      child so recently taken from their clutches shrank and
      cowered against her young protectress.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't let them take me&mdash;don't!" she kept wailing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never mind; don't be scared, Wren," Peggy comforted, "they
      won't get you."
    </p>
    <p>
      A flash of determined fire came into Peggy's eyes as she
      spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Peg! You're magnificent," exclaimed Jess, as, headed by Miss
      Prescott, they hastened toward the car which Jake had already
      cranked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gipsies had paused for an instant. Evidently the sight of
      the a&euml;roplanes bewildered and amazed them. Expecting to
      come on a camp of young folks they had suddenly encountered a
      group of machines which, to them, must have savored of the
      supernatural. But as the auto drove off they were due for an
      even greater surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following a swift whisper from Roy both boys had jumped into
      the <i>Red Dragon</i>. In an instant came the sharp barking
      of the engine. The flying machine dashed forward almost
      simultaneously. Straight at the angry nomads Roy headed it.
      It was as if a war chariot of old was charging into a group
      of defiant barbarians.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a few moments the gipsies stood their ground. But as the
      machine rose from the ground, skimmed it, as it were, Roy
      thrust on full power. The machine darted over the spot where
      the gipsies had stood but an instant before; but they had
      gone. Scattering with wild cries of fear, they could be seen
      running for their lives toward the wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think they'll trouble us again in a hurry," declared
      Roy grimly, as he brought the <i>Red Dragon</i> round in a
      circle and headed back for the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the machine came a cheer, Miss Prescott's voice ringing
      out as loudly as any.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The idea just came to me in a second," explained Roy
      modestly, in answer to the ladies' congratulations and
      praise, "it worked, though, didn't it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Like a charm," they all agreed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hadn't we better be getting on?" asked Jimsy, a minute
      later.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; there's no knowing if those fellows won't try a flank
      attack, although I think they've had a big enough scare
      thrown into them to last them quite a while with economy,"
      laughed Roy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is going to take care of Wren?" asked Bess.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She'll ride right in the car with me," declared Miss
      Prescott positively, "you don't think I'm going to risk her
      in one of those things of yours, do you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      They all laughed. As a matter of fact, there was not one of
      the party that was not more at home in the air than on a
      road. Then, too, Roy's balancing device had about removed the
      last peril of air traveling. It was agreed to stop at
      Meadville, which the map showed was about thirty miles to the
      southeast, and purchase a dress and other necessities for
      their new ward. As to what was to be done with her after that
      nobody had any very definite plans. And so the journey was
      resumed, with congratulations flying over the way in which
      they came out of what, for a time, looked like a really
      serious scrape.
    </p>
    <p>
      The weather had held fair till a short time after the start
      was made from the scene of the encounter with the gipsies. It
      was Peggy who first observed a change in the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the southwest billowy masses of slate-colored clouds
      came rolling on, obscuring the sunlit landscape beneath with
      an effect of lights turned down on a stage. Turning to Jess,
      who occupied the seat behind her, she remarked:
    </p>
    <p>
      "We're going to have some bad kind of a storm, girlie."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jess nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wonder how far we are from Meadville?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite a way yet. I'm afraid that we can't make it before the
      storm breaks."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look, there's Roy coming back, and Jimsy, too. I guess they
      want to talk about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      This turned out to be the case. As Roy came swinging by he
      held a small megaphone to his mouth with one hand, while the
      other gripped the steering wheel tightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We're in for a storm, girls, and a hummer, too, from the
      look of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Better drop down," counseled Jimsy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jess nodded, and, as at this moment Bess, who had seen the
      boy's maneuver, came by, the news was communicated to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next thing to do was to look about for a suitable place
      to land. The country over which they were passing was heavily
      wooded, and seemingly sparsely populated. Beneath them wound
      a road, along which, but at some distance behind, the touring
      car could be seen coming in a cloud of yellow dust.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wind began to grow puffy, and it required all the skill
      of the young aviators to keep their flock of motor-driven
      birds on even wings. Before long, just as the distant, but
      fast approaching, cloud curtain began to be ripped and
      slashed by vivid scimitars of lightning, Roy espied, beneath
      them, a field, at one end of which stood a prosperous-looking
      farmhouse, surrounded by buildings and hay stacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an ideal spot in which to land, and as the road was
      near by they would have no difficulty in attracting the
      attention of Miss Prescott when she went by. In graceful
      volplanes the a&euml;roplanes lit in the field like an
      alighting flight of carrier pigeons. But hardly had they
      touched the ground when from the farmhouse a man came running
      in his shirtsleeves, his lower limbs being garbed in overalls
      and knee-boots. On his chin was a goatee, and as he drew
      closer they saw that his face was thin and hatchet shaped and
      anything but agreeable.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You git out of thar! You git out of thar!" he kept shouting
      as he came along, stumbling over the stubble, for the field
      had been newly reaped.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, what's the matter? We're not hurting anything,"
      objected Roy; "surely you don't mind our occupying the field
      for an hour or so till the storm blows over?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I daon't, hey? Wa'al, I do, by heck. I own all the way daown
      and all the way up frum this farm, and thet's ther law."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If we didn't have these ladies with us we'd be only too glad
      to leave your field," rejoined Jimsy, "but you can see for
      yourself a nasty storm is coming up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What bizness hes gals riding round in them sky-buggies,"
      stormed the farmer; "ef any darter uv mine did it I'd lock
      her up on bread an' water, by Jim Hill."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't doubt it in the least," smiled Peggy sweetly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Humph!" grunted the cantankerous old agriculturist, not
      quite sure if he was being made fun of or if his resolution
      was being admired; "all I got to say is thet ef you want to
      stay here you gotter pay."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That can be arranged," spoke Jimsy, with quiet sarcasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "An' pay wa'al, too," resumed the farmer tenaciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How much do you think the lease of your field for an hour or
      so is worth?" asked Roy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The farmer considered an instant, and then, with an
      avaricious look in his pin-point blue eyes, he looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Bout ten dollars," he said, at length.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We don't want to buy it, we just want to rent it for a very
      short time," struck in Bess, with her most innocent
      expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wa'al, it's ten or git off!" snapped the farmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll pay you a fair price for it," spoke up Roy, "and not a
      cent more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I'll drive you off with a shot-gun, by chowder."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no, you won't."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Won't, hey? What'll stop me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The law."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ther law? Thet's a good one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think it is, a very good one," struck in Jimsy, who now
      saw what Roy was driving at.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Humph! wa'al, if yer a'goin' te talk law I'll jes' tell yer
      quick thet this is my land and thet you're all
      a-trespassing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are not very well up on a&euml;rial law, it seems,"
      replied Roy, in an absolutely unruffled tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't know nuthin' 'bout this air-ile law," grumbled the
      fellow, but somewhat impressed by Roy's calm, deliberate
      exterior.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then, for your information I'll tell you that under
      the laws of the country recently enacted aviators are
      entitled to land in any safe landing place in times of
      emergency. If they do any damage they must pay for it. If not
      the owner of the land is not entitled to anything for the
      temporary use of his place."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Five dollars or nothing," spoke Jimsy, "and if you try to
      put us off you'll get into serious trouble."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wa'al, yer a-robbin' me," muttered the man, much impressed
      by Roy's oratory, "gimme ther five."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was quickly forthcoming. The old fellow took it without a
      word and shuffled off. As he did so there was a vivid flash
      of lightning and the growl of a big crash of thunder. While
      it was still resounding the auto came puffing up. Jake had
      put up the storm top and made it as snug and comfortable as a
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come on, boys and girls," urged Roy, "let's get the engines
      covered up and then beat it for the car. The rain will hit in
      in torrents in a few minutes."
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed they were still making fast the waterproof covers
      constructed to throw over the motors in just such emergencies
      when the big drops began to fall.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a helter-skelter race for the car. In they all
      crowded, and none too soon. The air was almost as dark as at
      dusk, and there was a heavy sulphurous feeling in the
      atmosphere. But within the curtains of the car all was fun
      and merriment. The case of the old farmer was discussed at
      length, and Jimsy convulsed them all by his clever imitation
      of the way the bargain was driven.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was in the midst of his description when a fearfully vivid
      flash lit up the interior of the car as brightly as day. As
      it did so The Wren uttered a sharp cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it, dear? Afraid of the lightning?" asked Miss
      Prescott, while a thunder volley boomed and reverberated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no," shivered the child, drawing closer to her, "but
      when I see a flash like that I sometimes remember."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Remember what?" asked Miss Prescott tenderly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I don't know," wailed the child, "people and places.
      They come for a moment and then disappear again as quickly as
      they came."

    <h3>
      PEGGY'S THOUGHTFULNESS SAVES THE FARM.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Flash after flash, roar after roar, the lightning and thunder
      crashed and blazed as the full fury of the storm struck in.
      Miss Prescott, who was in deadly fear of lightning, covered
      her eyes with a thick veil and sank back in the cushions of
      the tonneau.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the rest of the party regarded the furious storm with
      interest. The rain was coming down in sheets, but not one
      drop penetrated the water-proof top of the big touring car.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's grand, isn't it?" asked Peggy, after a particularly
      brilliant flash.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Um&mdash;ah, I don't just know," rejoined Jess, "it's rather
      too grand if anything. I&mdash;&mdash;" Bang!
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a sharp report, like that of a large cannon. The
      air was filled with an eye-blistering blaze of blue fire.
      Stunned for an instant, and half blinded, not one of the
      young folks in the touring car uttered a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      The storm, too, appeared to be "holding its breath" after
      that terrific bombardment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That struck close by," declared Roy, the first to recover
      his speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! oh!" moaned Miss Prescott, "then the next will hit us!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't be a goose, Aunt Sally," comforted Peggy; "don't you
      know that lightning never strikes twice in the same place?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Prescott made no answer. In fact she had no opportunity
      to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      From close at hand shouts were coming. Loud, frightened
      shouts.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fire! fire!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gracious! something's on fire at that farmhouse!" cried
      Peggy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's what!" came in excited tones from Roy as he peered
      out through the rain.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look at them running about," chimed in Jimsy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's from that haystack! See the smoke roll up!" cried Bess.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The lightning must have struck it. Say, we'd better go and
      help," exclaimed Roy anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't see that the old man who was so mean to us deserves
      any help," murmured Bess, rather angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, Bess, for shame!" reproved Peggy. "Go on, boys, the
      rain's letting up, maybe you can help them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right, sis. Come on, Jimsy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The boys dived out of the car and set off running at top
      speed for the scene of the blaze, which was in a haystack
      back of the main barn of the farmhouse. Several farm hands,
      under the direction of the disagreeable old man, whose name
      was Zenas Hutchings, were running about with buckets of
      water, which were about as effective as trying to sweep the
      sea back with a broom, so far as gaining any headway against
      the flames was concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had the rain continued it might have been possible for the
      farm hands to quell the blaze with the assistance of the
      elements; but the storm had ceased almost as suddenly as it
      began, and only a few scattering drops were now falling. Off
      to the southwest the sky was blue once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      The farmer turned despairingly to the boys as they came
      running up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Clare ter goodness if it ain't them kids ag'in," he
      exclaimed; "wa'al, you ain't brought me nuthin' but bad luck
      so far as I kin see. Hyars a hundred dollars' worth of hay
      goin' up in smoke an'&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      A farm hand came bustling up. His face was pale under the
      grime of soot that overlaid it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ef we don't git ther fire under control purty soon," he
      cried, "ther whole place 'ull go."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's thet, Jed?" snapped old Hutchings anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I said that ther sparks is beginning ter fly. If ther fire
      gits much hotter it'll set suthin' else ablaze."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By heck! That's so!" cried old Hutchings, in an alarmed
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gazed about him perplexedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Isn't there any fire apparatus near here?" asked Roy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yep; at Topman's Corners. But that's five miles off."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you telephoned them?" asked Jimsy, who had noticed that
      the Hutchings farm, like most up-to-date ones, was equipped
      with a telephone; at least there were wires running into the
      place which appeared to be of that nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ain't no use telephoning" was the disconsolate rejoinder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wire's busted. Reckon ther storm put it out of business. I
      guess it's all up with me now. I hoped ter pay off ther part
      of ther mortgage with ther hay and grain in thet barn yonder,
      an' now&mdash;&mdash;" He broke off in a half sob.
      Cantankerous as the old man had shown himself to be, and
      grasping withal, the boys could not help but feel sorry for
      the stricken old fellow. He looked pitifully bowed and old
      and wretched in the midst of his distracted farm hands, who
      were running about and shouting and not doing much of
      anything else.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wa'al," he said, at length, pulling himself together with a
      visible effort, "thar's no chance of gitting ther fire
      ingines, so it'll hev ter go, I guess."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes there is a chance of getting the engines, and a good
      one, too."
    </p>
    <p>
      They all turned at the sound of a girlish voice, and there
      stood Peggy with Jess by her side. The two girls had stolen
      up unnoticed in the excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bravo, Peg!" exclaimed Roy heartily, glancing approvingly at
      his sister, "what's your idea?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fly over and get help."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fly over! Wa'al, I'll be switched!" gasped old Hutchings.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't see why not," struck in Jimsy, "it's five miles, you
      say. Well, we ought to make that in ten minutes or so, or
      even quicker."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How fast can the engines get back?" asked Roy practically.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wa'al, ther roads be good and Bob Shields hez a right smart
      team," was the rejoinder. "They ought ter make it in half an
      hour."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good. Then if you can hold the flames in check for a short
      time longer we can save your place yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      Beckoning to Jimsy, the boy darted off for the <i>Red
      Dragon</i>. This machine he selected because, with the
      exception of the <i>Dart</i>, it was the fastest and lightest
      of the a&euml;roplanes they had with them. Farmer Hutchings
      had hardly closed his mouth from its gaping expression of
      surprise when a whirr of the motor announced that the <i>Red
      Dragon</i> was off. Its lithe body shot into the air with
      tremendous impetus.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ther Corners is off thar to ther westward," shouted up the
      farmer, "you can't miss it. It's got a red brick church with
      a high tower on it right in the middle of a clump of elms."
    </p>
    <p>
      Speeding above fields and woodland the red messenger of
      pending disaster raced through the air. Five minutes after
      taking flight Jimsy espied a high red tower. Eight and one
      half minutes after the <i>Dragon</i> had shot aloft it
      fluttered to earth on the village street of Topman's Corners,
      amid an amazed group of citizens who had seen it approaching.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the first a&euml;roplane ever seen in the remote
      Pennsylvanian hamlet, and it created commensurate excitement.
      But the boys had no time to answer the scores of questions,
      foolish and otherwise, that were volleyed at them from all
      sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's a fire!" exclaimed Jimsy breathlessly, "a fire at
      Hutchings's farm. How soon can you get the engines there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      A stalwart-looking young fellow stepped up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm chief of the department," he said, "we're the
      'Valiants.' I'll be there in twenty-five minutes if I have to
      kill the horses. It's downhill most of the way, anyhow. Jim,
      you run off and ring ther bell."
    </p>
    <p>
      A second later the fire bell was loudly clanging and several
      of the crowd melted away to don their helmets and coats. In
      less time than the boys would have thought it possible a
      good-looking engine came rumbling out of the fire house half
      a block down the street. Behind it came a hook and ladder
      truck.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fine horses were attached to each, and from the way they
      leaped off the boys saw that the "Chief" meant to make good
      his promise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Race you to ther fire!" shouted the latter functionary, as,
      in a storm of cheers, his apparatus swept out of sight down
      the elm-bordered street.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're on," laughed Roy, whisking aloft while the Topman's
      Cornerites were still wondering within themselves if they
      were waking or dreaming.

      CHAPTER VI.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE GIRL AVIATORS IN DEADLY PERIL.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The fire was out. A smoldering, blackened hillock was all
      that remained of the stack ignited by the lightning bolt; but
      the others and the main buildings of the farm had been saved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such work was a new task for a&euml;roplanes&mdash;but there
      is no doubt that, had it not been for Peggy's suggestion, the
      Hutchings farm would have been burned to the ground. As it
      was, when the firemen, their horses in a lather, arrived at
      the scene, the farm hands, who had been fighting the flames,
      were almost exhausted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had they possessed the time, the young folks would have been
      glad to tell the curious firemen something about their
      a&euml;roplanes. But it was well into the afternoon, and if
      they intended to keep up their itinerary it was necessary for
      them to be hurrying on. A short time after the blaze had been
      declared "out" the a&euml;roplanes once more soared aloft,
      and the auto chugged off in the direction of Meadville.
    </p>
    <p>
      The afternoon sun shone sparklingly on the trees and fields
      below, all freshened by the downpour of the early afternoon.
      The spirits of all rose as did their machines as they raced
      along. Before leaving the Hutchings farm the old man had been
      so moved to generosity by the novel manner in which his farm
      had been saved from destruction that he had offered to give
      back $2.50 of the $5 he had demanded for the rent of his
      field. Of course they had not taken it, but the evident
      anguish with which the offer was made afforded much amusement
      to the young aviators as they soared along.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Peggy's machine the talk between herself and Jess was of
      the strange finding of The Wren, and of the child's curious
      ways. Both girls recalled her odd conduct during the storm
      and what she had said about the peculiar influence of
      lightning on her memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Depend on it, Jess," declared Peggy, with conviction, "that
      child is no more a gipsy than you or I."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you think she was stolen from somewhere?" asked Jess,
      readily guessing the drift of her friend's thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know, but I'm sure they had no legal right to her,"
      was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Peg! Suppose she should turn out to be a missing
      heiress!" Jess, who loved a romance, clasped her gauntleted
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peggy laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Missing heiresses are not so common as you might suppose,"
      she said; "I never met any one who had encountered any,
      except in story books."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Still, it would be great if we had really found a long
      missing child, or&mdash;or something like that," concluded
      Jess, rather lamely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't see how we would be benefiting the child or its
      parents, either, since we have no way of knowing who the
      latter are," rejoined the practical Peggy, which remark
      closed the discussion for the time being.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not more than half an hour later when Jess uttered a
      sharp cry of alarm. From the forward part of the
      a&euml;roplane a wisp of smoke had suddenly curled upward.
      Like a blue serpent of vapor it dissolved in the air almost
      so quickly as to make Jess believe, for an instant, that she
      had been the victim of an hallucination.
    </p>
    <p>
      But that it was no figment of the imagination was evidenced a
      few moments later by Peggy herself. Aroused by Jess's cry,
      she had made an inspection of the machine, with alarming
      results. What these were speedily became manifest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jess! The machine is on fire!" she cried afrightedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      As if in verification of her words there came a puff of flame
      and a strong reek of gasoline. It was just then that both
      girls recalled that the <i>Golden Butterfly</i> carried
      twenty-five gallons of gasoline, without counting the reserve
      supply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fire on an a&euml;roplane is even more terrifying than a
      similar casualty on any other type of machine. Hardly had
      Peggy's words confirming the alarming news left her lips when
      there came a cry from Jess.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl had just glanced at the barograph. It showed that
      they were then 1,500 feet above the surface of the earth. The
      girl had hardly made this discovery before, from beneath the
      "bow" of the monoplane, came a wave of flame; driven from the
      steering wheel by the heat, Peggy drew back toward her
      companion. Her face was ashen white.
    </p>
    <p>
      Left to itself the a&euml;roplane "yawed" wildly, like a
      craft without a rudder. Then suddenly it dashed down toward
      the earth, smoke and flames leaping from its front part.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both girls uttered a cry of terror as the aircraft fell like
      a stone hurled into space. Faster and faster it dashed
      earthward without a controlling hand to guide it. It was at
      this instant that Roy and Jimsy became aware of what had
      happened.
    </p>

      "Both Girls Uttered a Cry of Terror As the Air Craft Fell Like a Stone Hurled into Space.">
      </center>
    <p>
      Instantly they swung their machine around in time to see the
      <i>Golden Butterfly</i> make her sickening downward swoop.
      Both lads uttered a cry of fear as they saw what appeared to
      mean certain death for the two Girl Aviators.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roy's fingers scarcely grasped the wheel of his machine as he
      saw the downward drop. Jimsy was as badly affected. But
      almost before they could grasp a full realization of the
      accident the <i>Golden Butterfly</i> was almost on the
      ground. It was in a hilly bit of country, interspersed by
      small lakes or ponds.
    </p>
    <p>
      A freak of the wind caught the blazing a&euml;roplane as it
      fell and drove it right over one of these small bodies of
      water.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Golden Butterfly</i> appeared to hesitate for one
      instant and then plunged right into the water, flinging the
      two girls out. Both were expert swimmers, but the shock of
      the sudden descent, and the abrupt manner in which they had
      been flung into the water had badly unstrung their nerves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jess struck out valiantly, but the next instant uttered a
      cry:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Peg! Peg! I'm sinking!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Peggy pluckily struck out for her chum and succeeded in
      seizing her. Then with brisk strokes she made for the shore,
      luckily only a few yards distant. It was at this juncture
      that the boys' machines came to earth almost simultaneously.
      High above Bess's <i>Dart</i> hovered, and presently it, too,
      began to drop downward. Apparently the accident had not been
      seen from the auto, at any rate the car was not turned back
      toward the scene of the accident.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the boys' a&euml;roplanes struck the earth not far from
      the bank of the pond toward which Peggy was at that moment
      valiantly struggling, the two young aviators leaped out and
      set out at a run to the rescue. They reached the bank in the
      nick of time to pull out the two drenched, half-exhausted
      girls.
    </p>
    <p>
      "At any rate the fall was a lucky one in a way!" gasped the
      optimistic Peggy, as soon as she caught her breath, "it put
      out the fire."
    </p>
    <p>
      And so it had. Not only that, but the a&euml;roplane, buoyed
      up by its broad wings, was still floating. On board the
      <i>Red Dragon</i> was a long bit of rope. Jimsy produced this
      and then swam out to the drifting <i>Butterfly</i>. The rope
      was made fast to it and the craft dragged ashore. But when
      they got it to the bank the problem arose as to how they were
      going to drag it up the steep acclivity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again and again they tried; Bess, who had by this time
      alighted, aiding them. But it was all to no purpose. Even
      their united strength failed to move the heavy apparatus.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've got an idea!" shouted Jimsy suddenly, during a pause in
      their laborious operations.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good! Don't let it get away, I beg of you!" implored Peggy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Peg! Don't tease, besides, you don't look a bit cute
      with your hair all wet and draggled, and as for your
      dress&mdash;goodness!"
    </p>
    <p>
      This came from Jess, herself sadly "rumpled" and in addition
      wet through. Before Peggy could reply to her chum's half
      rallying remark Jimsy, unabashed, continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'll hitch this rope to the <i>Red Dragon</i> and then
      start her up for all she's worth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jimsy, you're a genius!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A modern marvel!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A solid promontory of pure gray matter!"
    </p>
    <p>
      In turn the remarks came from each of the party. But Jimsy,
      bothering not at all at the laughing encomiums, proceeded to
      secure the rope to the <i>Red Dragon</i>. This done, he
      started up the engine and clambered into his seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All ashore that's going ashore!" he yelled, in mocking
      imitation of the stewards of an ocean liner.
    </p>
    <p>
      There wasn't an instant's hesitation as he threw the load
      upon the engine. Then the rope tautened. It grew tight as a
      fiddle string.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Goodness! It'll snap and the <i>Dragon</i> will be broken!"
      cried Jess, in alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      But no such thing happened. Instead, as the <i>Dragon's</i>
      powerful propeller blades "bit" into the air, the <i>Golden
      Butterfly</i> obediently mounted the steep bank of the pond.
      Five minutes later the pretty craft stood on dry land and the
      party of young aviators were eagerly making an investigation
      of the damage done.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cause of the fire was soon found. A tiny leak in the tank
      had allowed some gasoline to drip into the bottom of the
      chassis, or passenger carrier. Collecting here, it was plain
      that a back fire from the carburetor had ignited it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither of the girls could repress a shudder as they thought
      of what might have occurred had they been higher in the air
      and no convenient pond handy for them to drop into. In such a
      case the flames might have reached the gasoline tank before
      they could be extinguished and inevitably a fearful explosion
      would have followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think you are the two luckiest girls in the world,"
      declared Roy solemnly, as he concluded his examination and
      announced his conclusions. Naturally they fully agreed with
      him.

      A STOP FOR THE NIGHT.

    <p>
      It was some two hours later that Meadville received the
      greatest excitement of its career. People rushed out of
      stores and houses as the "flock" of a&euml;roplanes came into
      sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they gazed down the young aviators felt a momentary regret
      that they had chosen a town in which to pass the first night
      of their motor flight. It appeared that they would get into
      difficulties when they attempted to make a landing.
    </p>
    <p>
      But almost simultaneously they spied a public park, which
      appeared to offer a favorable landing place. As soon as their
      intention of descending there became manifest, however, the
      crowd made a headlong rush for the spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was too late to seek some other location to alight even
      had there been one available. Trusting to luck that the eager
      spectators would get out of their way the four
      a&euml;roplanes began their spiraling descent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roy was first in his big biplane. As the ponderous, white
      machine ranged down close to the park the crowd became
      well-nigh uncontrollable. They swarmed beneath the big
      machine, despite Roy's shouts of warning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Skillfully as the boy manipulated the aircraft he could not
      check its descent once begun.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Out of the way! I don't want to hurt you!" he shouted, as he
      dashed down.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the crowd, sheeplike in their stupidity, refused to
      budge. Into the midst of them Roy, perforce, was compelled to
      drive. Once the throng perceived his intention, however, they
      scattered wildly. That is, all sought positions of safety but
      one man, a stout, red-faced individual, who appeared dazed or
      befuddled.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood his ground, glaring foolishly at the sky ship. With
      a quick turn of his wrist Roy swept the big biplane aside,
      but a wing tip brushed the stout man, toppling him over in a
      twinkling. By the time Roy had stopped his machine the man
      was on his feet again, bellowing furiously. He was not hurt,
      but his face was contorted with anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pushed his way through the crowd toward the young aviator.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You young scoundrel!" he yelled, "I'll fix you for that!
      I'll&mdash;" "Look out, here come the rest of them!" shouted
      the crowd at this juncture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nobody needed any warning this time. They fled in all
      directions as one after the other the <i>Golden
      Butterfly</i>, the <i>Red Dragon</i> and the pretty, graceful
      <i>Dart</i> dropped to earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wa'al, look at them gals, will yer!" shouted a voice in the
      crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's the country coming to?" demanded another man. "Gals
      gallivanting around like gol-dinged birds!"
    </p>
    <p>
      But the majority of the crowd took the pretty girl aviators
      to its heart. Somebody set up a cheer.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was still ringing out when, to the huge relief of the
      embarrassed girls, the auto came rolling up with Miss
      Prescott and "The Wren," as they still called the latter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girls, leaving the boys to look after the
      a&euml;roplanes, ran to the side of the car and were speedily
      ensconced in its roomy tonneau. "We'll see you at the hotel!"
      cried Roy, as the car rolled off again, much to the
      disappointment of the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two local constables came up at this juncture and helped the
      boys keep the crowd back from the machines. The throng seemed
      souvenir mad. Many of them insisted on writing their names
      with pencils on the wings of the air craft. Others would have
      gone further and actually stripped the a&euml;roplanes of odd
      parts had they not been held back.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is the last time we'll land in a town of this size,"
      declared Roy indignantly, as he helped the constables shove
      back an obstreperous individual who insisted on examining the
      motor of the <i>Dart</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the help of the constables a sheltering place for the
      machines was finally found. A livery stable that had gone out
      of business the week before was located across the street
      from the small park in which they had alighted. The owner of
      the property happened to be in the crowd and a bargain with
      him was soon struck. The a&euml;roplanes were then trundled
      on their landing wheels into this shelter and the doors
      closed. Roy, for a small sum, engaged a tall,
      gangling-looking youth, whose name was Tam Tammas, to guard
      the doors and keep off the inquisitive. This done, thoroughly
      tired out, the boys sought the hotel. Like most towns of its
      size and importance Meadville only boasted one hostelry
      worthy of the name. This place, the Fountain House, as it was
      called, was a decent enough looking hotel and the young
      aviators were warmly welcomed. After supper, for in Meadville
      nobody "dined," Miss Prescott and the girls sauntered out
      with The Wren to obtain some clothing for the waif who had so
      strangely come into their possession. It was odd, but somehow
      they none of them even suggested giving up the queer little
      foundling to the authorities as had originally been their
      intention. Instead, although none of them actually voiced it,
      it appeared that tacitly they had decided to keep the child
      with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      While they were gone on their errand of helpfulness Roy and
      Jimsy were seated on the porch of the hotel watching, with
      more or less languid interest, the inhabitants of the town
      passing back and forth. Many of them lingered in front of the
      hotel, for aviators were not common objects in that part of
      the country, and already the party had become local
      celebrities.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I guess we'll go inside," said Roy, at length, "I'm getting
      sick of being looked at as if I was some sort of natural
      curiosity."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Same here," rejoined Jimsy, "we'll go in and I'll play you a
      game of checkers."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're on," was the response.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as the boys rose to go, or rather the instant before they
      left their seats, there came a heavy step behind Roy and a
      gruff voice snarled:
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you doing in that chair?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sitting in it," responded Roy, in not too pleasant a voice.
      The tone in which he had been addressed had aroused a hot
      resentment in him toward the speaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning he saw the same red-faced man whom he had been
      unfortunate enough to knock down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instantly his manner changed. He felt genuinely sorry for the
      accident and hastened to explain that such was the case. But
      a glowering glance was the only response he received. "You
      done it a-purpose. Don't tell me," snarled the red-faced
      individual, "an' now you git right out uv that chair
      or&mdash;or I'll make you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Both boys stared at the man in amazement. His tone was coarse
      and bullying to a degree.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are not occupying these chairs to your inconvenience,"
      declared Roy stoutly, "there are lots of others."
    </p>
    <p>
      He indicated several rockers placed at intervals along the
      hotel porch, and all empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That chair you're sitting in is mine," snapped the man, in
      response.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Got a mortgage on it, eh?" smiled Jimsy amiably.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll show you kids how much of a mortgage I've got on it,"
      was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was just then that a lad of about Roy's own age, but with
      a surly, hang-dog sort of look, emerged from the smoking-room
      of the hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's up, father?" he demanded, addressing the red-faced
      man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, Dan, the kids have appropriated my chair."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, those flying kids. Well, they'll see that they ain't
      everything around here," responded the lad; "I reckon Jim
      Cassell has some say here, eh, dad?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I reckon so, son," grinned the red-faced man, in response to
      this elegant speech; "now, then, are you going to give up
      that chair or not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was just leaving it when you came out," rejoined Roy, who,
      by this time, was fairly boiling over. "Under the present
      conditions, however, I think I shall continue to occupy it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will, eh?" snarled out Dan Cassell, "then I'll show you
      how to vacate it&mdash;so!"
    </p>
    <p>
      With the words he laid hands on the back of the chair and
      jerked it from under the young aviator. Roy, caught entirely
      off his guard, was flung to the floor of the porch. He was up
      in a flash, but as he rose to his feet Dan Cassell, evidently
      excited by what he deemed a great triumph, aimed a savage
      blow at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimsy was rushing to his assistance but the red-faced man
      suddenly blocked his path.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hold off, son! hold off!" he warned, "unless you want to get
      the same dose."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      ROY MAKES AN ENEMY.
    </h3>
    <p>
      In the meantime Roy had skillfully avoided Dan Cassell's
      blow, and was aggressively on the defensive. He was a lad who
      did not care for fighting, but notwithstanding was a trained
      boxer. Something of this seemed to dawn on Dan Cassell as the
      boy he sought to pummel dodged his attack with such
      cleverness.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Dan stood stock-still with doubled up fists and
      a scowl on his not unhandsome, though weak and vicious
      features. Then, with a bellow, he rushed upon Roy, who
      contented himself by sidestepping the furious onslaught.
    </p>
    <p>
      This appeared to enrage Dan Cassell the more. Either he
      interpreted it as portraying cowardice, or else he deemed
      that he had his opponent at his mercy. At any rate, after an
      instant's pause he rushed at Roy with both fists. It was the
      young aviator's opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look out!" he warned.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next instant the pugnacious Dan Cassell found himself
      upon his back, regarding a multitude of constellations.
    </p>
    <p>
      At almost precisely the same time Jimsy's fist happened to
      collide with the point of the jaw of the fallen battler's
      father.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sorry; but I simply had to, you know," remarked the
      nonchalant Jimsy, as the red-faced man found himself
      occupying a position not dissimilar to that of his son.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both boys were heartily sorry for what had happened, the more
      so for the reason that at the very instant that both
      crestfallen bullies were scrambling to their feet the hotel
      door opened and several of the guests came out to ascertain
      the cause of the trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among them was Jonas Hardcastle, the proprietor of the place.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's up? What's the trouble?" he demanded, in dismay, as
      he viewed the scene of the confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's those brats of aviators, or whatever they call
      themselves," bellowed Cassell, who was purple with fury;
      "they attacked Dan and me and assaulted us brutally."
    </p>
    <p>
      The landlord looked doubtingly at the man. Then he turned to
      Roy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are the facts?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roy told him unhesitatingly the whole truth. When he had
      concluded Jonas Hardcastle spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've been hanging around here too long, Jim Cassell," he
      said, in a voice that quivered with indignation; "now make
      yourself scarce, both you and your son. Don't annoy my guests
      any more."
    </p>
    <p>
      Cassell, nursing a spot on his jaw which was rapidly growing
      a beautiful plum color, lurched off without a word. His son
      followed. It was not until he reached the street that he
      spoke. Then, in a voice that trembled from suppressed fury,
      he hissed out:
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right for you kids. You think you've played a smart
      trick on Dan and me; but I'll fix you! Just watch!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Without uttering another syllable he slouched off into the
      gathering darkness, followed by his son, who bestowed a
      parting scowl on Roy and Jimsy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sorry that you had a row with them," remarked Jonas
      Hardcastle, as the pair vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How's that?" inquired Roy. "They forced it on us,
      and&mdash;" "I know. I know all about that," was the
      rejoinder, "but Cassell is quite by way of being a politician
      hereabouts, and he might try to make it uncomfortable for
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In what way?" demanded Jimsy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, many ways. Those fellows have no scruples. To tell you
      the truth, boys, I guess you haven't heard the last of this."
    </p>
    <p>
      With this he left them, a prey to no very comfortable
      thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm half inclined to believe what he said," declared Jimsy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In just what way?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, about the harm this fellow Cassell can do us. In every
      community like this you'll find one local 'Pooh-bah' who runs
      things pretty much as he likes. They have satellites who will
      do just about as they're told."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean&mdash;" "That we'd better keep a good lookout on
      the a&euml;roplanes. From my judgment of Cassell I don't
      think he's got nerve enough to attack us directly, but he can
      wreak his vengeance on our machines if we don't watch pretty
      closely."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm inclined to think you're right. But don't say a word of
      all this to the girls. It might upset them. You and I will
      decide on a plan of action later on. To tell you the truth,
      I'm not any too sure of our newly acquired watchman, Tam
      Tammas."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor I. We'll wait till the rest get back and then take a
      stroll down to that livery stable. Seems funny, doesn't it,
      to stable a&euml;roplanes in a livery stable?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, why not? Wasn't Pegasus, the first flying machine on
      record, a horse?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Humph; that's so," agreed Jimsy, whose supply of classical
      knowledge was none too plentiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not long after this that the girls returned. With them
      came The Wren in a neat dress and new shoes, an altogether
      different looking little personage from the waif of the woods
      whom they had rescued at noon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, Wren," cried Peggy, "you are positively pretty. In a
      month's time we won't know you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A month's time?" sighed the child; "am I going to stay with
      you as long as that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Prescott caught the wan little figure in her arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, and many months after that," she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roy and Jimsy exchanged glances.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Another member of the family," exclaimed Roy; "if we go at
      this rate we'll have acquired an entire set of new sisters by
      the time we reach the Big Smokies."

      CHAPTER IX.

    <h3>
      JIMSY FALLS ASLEEP.
    </h3>
    <p>
      "Anybody been around, Tam?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Roy asked the question, as later on that evening he and Jimsy
      dropped around to the disused livery stable in accordance
      with their plan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tam shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nobody bane round," he rejoined, and then, after a moment's
      pause, "'cept Yim Cassell and his boy Dan."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jim Cassell and his son," echoed Roy, "the very people we
      don't want around here. What did they want?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They want know where you bane," rejoined the Norwegian
      youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; and what did you tell them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I bane tell them I skall not know," responded Tam.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They bane ask me if ay have key by door."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, they did, eh? What did you say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I say I bane not have key."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then what did they do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They bane go 'way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Didn't say anything else?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, they must go."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Said nothing about coming back?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right, Tarn, you can go home now. Here's your money."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You bane want me no more?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; we'll watch here ourselves to-night. Good night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good night," rejoined Tam, pocketing his money and shuffling
      off down the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had hardly gone two blocks when from the shadow of an
      elm-shaded yard the figure of Dan Cassell slipped out and
      intercepted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So you've been fired, eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He shot the question at the simple-minded Norwegian lad with
      vicious emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I no bane fired; they bane tell me no want me more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, isn't that being fired? Moreover, I can tell you that
      they've hired another fellow in your place."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Norwegian youth's light blue eyes lit up with indignant
      fire. Like most of his race he was keenly sensitive once
      aroused, and while he was quite agreeable to being dropped
      from his temporary job, he hated to think of being supplanted
      in it. Crafty Dan Cassell was playing his cards well, for a
      purpose that will be seen ere long.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So they bane fire me," ejaculated Tam.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's the size of it. I guess you feel pretty sore, Tam,
      don't you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, they bane pay me wale; but I no like being fired."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should think not. The idea of a man like you being
      dropped. What did they tell you when they let you go?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That they bane watch place themselves."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dan Cassell smiled. His crafty methods had elicited something
      of real value after all.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did they say they were going to watch all night?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," rejoined the Norwegian, "they ask about you, too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Humph! What did they want to know?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you'd been round by stable and what I bane tale you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What did you say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I tale them the truth. I say that you and your father bane
      by stable this evening."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dan's face darkened.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You had no business to tell them anything," he snarled.
      Then, with a sudden change of front: "See here, Tam, do you
      want to make some money?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure, I bane like make money."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then come into the house a minute. Dad and I want to talk to
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying Dan took the Norwegian by the arm and led him in
      through a gate in a whitewashed picket fence. Beyond the
      fence was a fairly prosperous looking house, on the piazza of
      which lounged Jim Cassell smoking a cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Tam," he said, "lost your job?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Norwegian replied in the affirmative.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, never mind, I've got another for you," replied Jim
      Cassell, in what was for him an unwontedly amiable tone; "can
      you go to work at once?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay bane work any time skol be," spoke the Norwegian, and a
      puzzled expression flitted over his face as both Cassells
      broke into what was to him an inexplicable fit of laughter at
      his words.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime the boys had telephoned to the hotel that
      work on the a&euml;roplanes would detain them till late. They
      did not wish to inform the girls that they were undertaking a
      night watch, as that would have led to all sorts of
      questions, and if their fears proved ungrounded they felt
      pretty sure of coming in for a lot of "joshing."
    </p>
    <p>
      They agreed to divide the night into two parts, Jimsy
      watching till midnight and then awakening Roy who would take
      up the vigil till dawn. This arrangement having been made
      they secured a light lantern from an adjacent hardware store
      and, entering the deserted livery stable, prepared to carry
      out their plans. With the canvas covers of the
      a&euml;roplanes Roy managed to fix up quite a comfortable bed
      on a pile of hay left in a sort of loft over the abandoned
      stable.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Jimsy, he made himself as comfortable as possible in
      the chassis of the <i>Golden Butterfly</i>, the seats of
      which were padded as luxuriously as those of a touring car.
      He had a book dealing with aeronautic subjects with him, and,
      drawing the lantern close to the a&euml;roplane, he buried
      himself in the volume.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime Roy had rolled himself up in his canvas
      coverings and was sound asleep. For a long time Jimsy read
      on. At first frequent footsteps passed the door of the
      stable, but as it grew later these ceased. Folks went to bed
      early in Meadville. Long before midnight there was not a
      sound on the streets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimsy read doggedly on. But he was painfully conscious of an
      almost irresistible desire to lie back and doze off, if only
      for a few seconds. The exciting events of the day had tired
      him out, nor was the book he was reading one calculated to
      keep his wits stirring. It was a technical work of abstruse
      character.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimsy's head began to nod. With a sharp effort he aroused
      himself only to catch himself dozing off once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      "See here, Jim Bancroft, this won't do," he sharply
      admonished himself, "you're on duty, understand? On duty!
      Wake up and keep your eyes open."
    </p>
    <p>
      But try as he would tired Nature finally asserted herself.
      Jimsy's head fell forward, his eyes closed for good and he
      snored in right good earnest. He was sound asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was about half an hour after he dozed off that a window in
      the rear of the stable framed a face. A crafty, eager face it
      was, as the yellow light of the lantern revealed its
      outlines. Dan Cassell, for it was he, gazed sharply about
      him. He swiftly took in the posture of the sleeping boy and a
      smile spread over his countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dropping from the ladder he had raised outside, he joined two
      figures waiting for him in the shadow of the livery barn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's too easy," he chuckled, "only one kid there and he's
      sound asleep. Got everything ready?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dey all bane ready, Maister Cassell," rejoined the slow,
      drawling voice of the Norwegian Tam.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now don't botch the job," warned the elder Cassell, who was
      the third member of the party; "remember it means a lot of
      trouble for us if we're caught."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No danger of that, dad. Come on, I'll go first and you and
      Tam follow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is the window open?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, but it slides back. It's an easy drop to the floor from
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right, go ahead. I'll be glad when the job's over. I'm
      almost inclined to drop out of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And let those kids get away with what they did? Not much,
      dad. We'll give them a lesson they won't forget in a hurry.
      Come on."
    </p>
    <p>
      He began climbing the ladder. Behind him came his worthy
      parent, and Tam formed the last member of the now silent
      procession. The Norwegian carried a bulky package of some
      kind, the contents of which it would have been impossible to
      guess save that it gave out a metallic sound as Tam moved
      with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dan Cassell reached the window, slid it noiselessly back in
      its grooves and then, crawling through, dropped lightly to
      the floor within. He was followed by his father and Tam.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Jimsy slept on. Slept heavily and dreamlessly, while
      deadly peril crept upon him.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      PEGGY'S INTUITION.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The movements of the invaders of the stable, which now housed
      the "winged steeds" of the young aviators, were mysterious in
      the extreme. The Norwegian carried a tin can containing some
      sort of liquid which he was ordered to pour about the floor
      in the neighborhood of the a&euml;roplanes. This done, Dan
      Cassell collected several scraps of litter and made quite a
      pile of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All ready now, I guess," he said, with what was meant as an
      attempt at a grin. But his lips were pale, and his forced
      jollity was a dismal failure. As for his father, he made no
      attempt to conceal his agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dan, they may be burned alive," he faltered; "better call it
      all off."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not when we've gone as far as this with it," was the
      rejoinder; "give me a match."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dan!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's all right, dad. They'll wake in time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But if not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then they'll have to take their medicine."
    </p>
    <p>
      With fingers that trembled as if their owner was palsied, Jim
      Cassell handed his son some matches. The latter took one,
      bent low over the pile he had collected and struck the
      lucifer.
    </p>
    <p>
      A yellow sputter of flame followed, and the next instant he
      was holding it to the pile of litter which had been
      previously soaked by the contents of the Norwegian's can.
    </p>
    <p>
      But before he could accomplish his purpose and set fire to
      the pile of odds and ends saturated to double inflammability
      by the kerosene the Norwegian had carried, there came a
      startling interruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a knock at the door and a girlish voice cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Roy! Roy, let me in!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Furies!" exclaimed Dan Cassell under his breath. "It's one
      of those girls."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come on. Let's get away quick!" exclaimed his father,
      trembling from nervous agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not before I set a match to this," exclaimed Dan Cassell
      viciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      He touched the match to the pile and the flames leaped up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now for our getaway," he cried, and the three fire-bugs ran
      for the window by which they had made their entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime a perfect fusillade of blows had been
      showered on the door outside. Jimsy awoke just as the last of
      the three midnight intruders vanished through the window. His
      first instinct was a hot flush of shame over the feeling that
      he had betrayed his trust.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then to his ears came the voice that had alarmed the Cassells
      and their tool.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Roy! Jimsy! Are you there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's Peggy!" gasped Jimsy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And Jess," he added the next instant, and simultaneously
      there came the pounding of a stick on the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is an officer of the law. Open up at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimsy, dazed by his sleep, had not till then noticed the
      blazing pile of litter. Now he did so with a quick cry of
      horror. The stuff was blazing up fiercely. Already there was
      an acrid reek in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The place is on fire!" he shouted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next moment there came a violent assault on the door and
      the crazy lock parted from its rotten fastenings as a man
      attired in a police officer's uniform burst into the place.
      Behind him came two wide-eyed frightened girls. The leaping
      flames lit up their faces vividly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's fire sure enough!" cried the police officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Great Scot, what's happening?"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Roy who shouted the question. He was peering down from
      the loft where he had been sleeping. The uproar had awakened
      him and in a jiffy he was among them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quick! the fire extinguishers!" he cried, and Jimsy, readily
      understanding, secured the flame-killing apparatus from the
      biplane and from the <i>Red Dragon</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      He and Roy, aided by the officer, fought the flames
      vigorously, and, luckily, were able to subdue them, though if
      it had not been for the as yet unexplained arrival of Peggy
      and Jess it is doubtful if they could have coped with the
      blaze. When it was all out Peggy rushed into explanations.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Something warned me that you were in danger," she exclaimed,
      "and I woke up Jess and we found this officer and came down
      here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What gift of second sight have you?" demanded Roy, gazing at
      the smoking, blackened pile that had threatened the
      destruction of the inflammable premises.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know. Womanly intuition, perhaps. Oh, Roy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl burst into a half-hysterical sob and threw her arms
      about her brother's neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You arrived in the nick of time, sis," he said, gently
      disengaging himself from her clasp, "a little more
      and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not finish the sentence. There was no need for him to.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Begorry, the ould place 'ud hev bin a pile of cinders in an
      hour's time," declared the policeman.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Jess's turn to give an hysterical little sob.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roy turned to Jimsy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you see anything? The place is reeking with kerosene. It
      was a plot to destroy the a&euml;roplanes and perhaps
      ourselves."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I&mdash;I&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimsy stammered. The words seemed to choke up in his throat.
      How was he to confess that he had failed in his
      trust&mdash;had slept while danger threatened?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Roy waited, plainly surprised. It was not like Jimsy to
      hesitate and stammer in this way.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last it came out with a rush.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I&mdash;I&mdash;you'll never forgive me, any of you&mdash;I
      was asleep."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Asleep! Oh, Jimsy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a world of reproach in Jess's voice. But Peggy
      interrupted her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How was it, Jimsy?" she asked softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know. I give you my word I don't know."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimsy's voice held a world of self-reproach.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was reading," he went on, hurrying over the words as if
      anxious to get his confession over with, "that book of
      Grotz's on monoplane navigation. I felt sleepy and&mdash;and
      the next thing I knew I woke up to hear you pounding on the
      door and shouting."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A good thing the young ladies found me," put in the
      policeman; "shure I was after laughing at them at first, but
      then, begorry, I decided to come along with them. It's glad I
      am that I did."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who can have done this?" asked Roy, who had not a word of
      reproach for his chum, although Jimsy had failed dismally in
      a position of trust.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Begorry, they might have burned you alive!" cried the
      policeman indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No question about that," rejoined Roy; "it was a diabolical
      plot. Who could have attempted such a thing?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait till I call up and have detectives sent down here,"
      said Officer McCarthy. "I'm after thinking this is too deep
      for us to solve."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, each of that little group but the policeman had
      his or her own idea on the matter.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      A MEAN REVENGE!
    </h3>
    <p>
      The result of the telephone call was a request to call at the
      Police Headquarters of the little town and give a detailed
      account of the affair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gracious! I should think that the only way to get a clue
      would be to send a detective down here," exclaimed Peggy, on
      receipt of this information.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have our own ways of doing them things, miss," rejoined
      the policeman with dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there being nothing for it but to obey instructions of
      the authorities, they all set out for the police station.
      They were half way there when Jimsy recollected that they had
      left the a&euml;roplanes unguarded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Twill make no difference at all at all," declared the
      policeman; "shure it's too late for anyone to be about."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It wasn't too late for them to set that fire though,"
      rejoined Roy in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      At police headquarters they were received by two
      sleepy-looking officials who questioned them at length and
      said they would be at the stable in the morning to hunt for
      clews.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not go after them now, while the trail is hot?" inquired
      Jimsy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have our own ways of doing these things, young man," was
      the reply, delivered with ponderous dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, we might as well go to bed and get a few hours' sleep
      anyhow," suggested Roy; "I can hardly keep my eyes open. How
      about you, Jimsy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I&mdash;I&mdash;I've had some sleep already you know,"
      rejoined Jimsy, reddening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thoroughly tired out from their long day and excitement, the
      party slept till late the next day. The first thing after
      breakfast plans for the continuance of the trip were
      discussed, and the day's program mapped out. This done, the
      girls and boys set out for the stable to look over the
      machines.
    </p>
    <p>
      They found a pompous-looking policeman on guard in front of
      the place, ostentatiously pacing up and down. On identifying
      themselves they were at once admitted however. The man
      explained that he had only been on guard for an hour or two,
      and that during that time nothing worthy of mention had
      occurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Jimsy was talking to him Roy and the others entered the
      stable. An instant later Roy, too excited to talk, came
      rushing out of the dis-used livery barn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's up now, Roy?" demanded Jimsy, gazing at his chum, who
      for his part appeared to be too excited to get his words out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's only three!" gasped Roy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Three what?" cried Jimsy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Three a&euml;roplanes," returned Roy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rubbish, you haven't got your eyes open yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm right, I tell you; come in and count them if you don't
      believe me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Roy is right," cried Peggy, running up to the group; "the
      <i>Golden Butterfly</i> has been stolen!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stolen!" interjected Jimsy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's right!" cried Jess; "those stupid police people left
      the barn unguarded. Whoever tried to set it on fire must have
      returned and stolen the <i>Butterfly</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      They regarded each other blankly. Was this Sky Cruise that
      they had looked forward to with such eager anticipation to be
      nothing but a series of mishaps?
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's awful!" gasped Peggy; "nothing but trouble since we
      started out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "D'ye think it was stolen?" asked the policeman with
      startling intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, it didn't fly of its own accord," was Peggy's
      rejoinder, delivered with blighting sarcasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The patrolman subsided.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Maybe we can find it yet," suggested Jess.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd like to know how," put in Jimsy disgustedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps we can trace it. It must have been wheeled away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ginger! That's so," cried Roy, snapping his fingers; "it
      would leave an odd track too, wouldn't it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well there's no harm in trying to trace it," admitted Jimsy,
      who appeared rather skeptical.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come on, then; get busy," urged Roy eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next instant there came a cry from Peggy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've struck the trail!" she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The word came in chorus.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here! Look; you know the <i>Butterfly</i> had peculiar kind
      of tires. See, it was wheeled up the street in that
      direction."
    </p>
    <p>
      She pointed to where the village main thoroughfare ended in a
      country road.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not after takin' much stock in that," remarked the
      policeman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We won't bother you," rejoined Roy rather heatedly; "I guess
      we won't wait till your local Sherlock Holmes gets on the
      trail, we'll follow it ourselves."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But who'll go?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The question came from Jimsy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We can't all go, that's certain," exclaimed Bess.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell you what we'll do, we'll count out," declared Jess, her
      eyes dancing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A good idea," hailed the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Roy, you start it; but remember, not more than three can
      go."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why?" inquired Peggy point blank.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because we'll have to take the car, and someone must be left
      to look after Aunt Sally and the a&euml;roplanes," spoke Roy,
      falling in with Jimsy's plans.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, come on and count out," urged Jess.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, that's it. Let's see who will be it," cried the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, if I can remember the rhyme," responded Roy. "How
      does it go anyway?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Inte, minte," suggested Jimsy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes! That's it," responded Roy. "I've got it now. Inte,
      minte, cute corn, apple seeds and briar thorn, briar thorn
      and limber lock, three geese in a flock, one flew east and
      one flew west, one flew into a cuckoo's nest, O-U-T out, with
      a ragged dish clout, out!" ending with Bess.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sorry for you, Bess!" cried the lad, "but you're the first
      victim to be offered up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, well, it's too hot to go chasing all over dusty country
      roads," declared Bess bravely, although she would dearly have
      loved to go on the adventurous search for the missing
      a&euml;roplane.
    </p>
    <p>
      One after another they were counted out till only Roy, Peggy
      and Jimsy remained.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hurry up and let's get off," urged Jimsy as the "elimination
      trials," as they might be termed, were concluded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well. We'll get the car&mdash;it's in the garage at the
      hotel&mdash;and incidentally, we might get a lunch put up
      also. It may be a long chase."
    </p>
    <p>
      The officer regarded them with frank amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My! but you city folks rush things," he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose they'll get busy on this case day after
      to-morrow," exclaimed Roy disgustedly, as they hastened away.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was half an hour later that the big touring car, with Roy
      at the wheel, rolled out of the hotel yard. Jake had been
      told off to guard the livery stable and the a&euml;roplanes
      while the rest remained with Miss Prescott, who was seriously
      agitated at the accumulation of troubles her party had met
      with since setting out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I declare," she said, "I wish I was back at home where I
      could get a decent cup of tea and be free of worries."
    </p>
    <p>
      The trail of the a&euml;roplane was not difficult to follow.
      It led down the village main street and thence along a
      country road till it came to a sort of cross roads. Here it
      branched off and followed a by-road for a mile or so. At a
      gate in a hedge all signs failed however, although it was
      plain that the machine had been wheeled through the gap and
      taken across a field.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond this field lay what appeared to be a wilderness of
      woods and bushes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stumped!" exclaimed Roy, as he brought the auto to a stop.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE FINDING OF THE "BUTTERFLY."
    </h3>
    <p>
      "Well, what next?" asked Jimsy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Make a search of those woods, I suppose," replied Roy;
      "there's nothing else to do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, the trail has brought us here," replied Peggy
      energetically; "we must make a determined effort to find the
      <i>Butterfly</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Maybe they've damaged it so that we won't be able to do
      anything with it when we do get it," spoke Jimsy presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whom do you mean by they?" asked Roy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As if you didn't know. Is there any doubt in your mind that
      that fellow Cassell is at the bottom of all this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not very much, I'll admit," replied Roy; "I wonder if that
      accounts for the inactivity of the police."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In just what way?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, the fellow's a local politician and has a lot of
      'pull'."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He <i>must</i> have, to get away with anything like this,"
      was Jimsy's indignant outburst.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, don't let us waste time speculating," put in Peggy, in
      her brisk manner; "the thing to do now is to get back the
      <i>Golden Butterfly</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're right, Peg," came from both boys.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time they were out of the car, which they left
      standing at the roadside while they examined the vicinity for
      tracks. But the grass in the field was fairly long and no
      traces remained. Yet, inasmuch as the tracks of the
      <i>Butterfly</i> ended at the gap in the hedge, it was
      manifest that that was the point at which it had been wheeled
      off the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What next?" asked Jimsy, as it became certain that there was
      little use in searching for a trail in the meadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's like looking for a needle in that proverbial haystack,"
      struck in Peggy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In my opinion we need the patience of Job and the years of
      old Methuselah," opined Jimsy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roy alone was not discouraged.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It can't be so very far off," he urged; "it stands to reason
      that they can't have come much further than this since
      midnight, supposing the machine to have been stolen about
      that hour."
    </p>
    <p>
      The others agreed with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'll search all around here, including those woods,"
      declared Peggy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, they can't have taken it very far into the woods,"
      declared Jimsy; "the spread of its wings would prevent that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's so," agreed Roy; "I think we are getting pretty
      'warm' right now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All I am afraid of is that they may have damaged it,"
      breathed Peggy anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It would be in line with their other tactics," agreed Roy;
      "men who would try to burn down a stable with two boys in it,
      just to obtain revenge for a fancied insult or injury, are
      capable of anything."
    </p>
    <p>
      Without further waste of time they crossed the meadow and
      came to the edge of the wood. At the outskirts of the woods
      the trees grew thinly and it was plain that it would have
      been possible to wheel an a&euml;roplane into their shadow,
      despite the breadth of its wing-spread.
    </p>
    <p>
      They passed under the outlying trees and presently emerged
      into a small, open space, in the midst of which was a hut.
      Just beyond this hut was a sight that caused them to shout
      aloud with joy. There, apparently unharmed, stood the missing
      a&euml;roplane.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hurray!" shouted Roy, dashing forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      The others were close on his heels. In their excitement they
      paid little or no attention to the surroundings. It might
      have been better for them had they done so. As they dashed
      across the clearing two male figures slipped off among the
      thicker trees that lay beyond the open space and the hut.
    </p>
    <p>
      A brief examination showed them that the a&euml;roplane was
      undamaged. There were a few scratches on it, but beyond that
      it appeared in perfect condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'll fly back," declared Jimsy to Peggy; "Roy can run the
      auto home."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's agreeable to me," responded Roy; "but suppose we
      examine the vicinity first. We might get a clew as to the
      rascals who are responsible for this."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's true," agreed Jimsy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then suppose we start with the hut first."
    </p>
    <p>
      They accepted this proposition eagerly. The hut was a
      substantial looking building with a padlock on the door. But
      the portal stood wide open, the padlock hanging in a hasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What if anyone pounces on us?" asked Peggy in rather a
      scared tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No fear of that," replied Roy, "the place is plainly
      unoccupied."
    </p>
    <p>
      They entered the hut and found it to be as primitive inside
      as its exterior would indicate. A table and two rude chairs
      stood within. These, with the exception of a rusty cook stove
      in one corner, formed the sole furnishings. There was not
      even a window in the place.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing much to be found here," declared Roy after a cursory
      examination; "I guess this shack was put up by lumbermen or
      hunters. It doesn't seem to have been occupied for a long
      time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I guess the men who took the a&euml;roplane must have been
      pretty familiar with the place though," opined Jimsy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No doubt of that," replied Roy, "but that doesn't give us
      any clew to their identity beyond bare suspicions."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, and suspicions aren't much good in law," chimed in
      Peggy, "they&mdash;Good gracious!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The door closed suddenly with a bang. Before Jimsy could
      spring across the room to open it there came a sharp click.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Somebody's padlocked it on the outside!" he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And we're prisoners!" gasped Peggy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, and without any chance of getting out, either,"
      declared Jimsy; "there's not even a window in the place."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well this is worse and more of it," cried Roy. "Who can have
      done that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The same people that stole the <i>Golden Butterfly,"</i>
      declared Peggy. "Hark!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside they heard rapidly retreating footsteps, followed by
      a harsh laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let us out!" shouted Roy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can stay there till judgment day, for all I care," came
      back a hoarse, rasping voice; "you kids were too fresh, and
      now you're getting what's coming to you."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      PRISONERS IN THE HUT.
    </h3>
    <p>
      It was almost pitch dark within the hut. Only from a crack
      under the door could any light enter. For an instant after
      the taunting of the voices of the men who had locked them in
      reached their ears, the trio of youthful prisoners remained
      silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peggy it was who spoke first.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, what's to be done now?" she demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We've got to get out of here," responded Jimsy, with
      embarrassing candor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's plain enough," struck in Roy; "but how do you propose
      to do it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know; let's look about. Maybe there's a chimney or
      something."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's no opening larger than that one where the stove pipe
      goes through. I've noticed that already," responded Roy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Phew! This <i>is</i> a fix for fair."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should say so; but kicking about it won't help us at all.
      Let's make a thorough investigation."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the darkness they groped about, but could discover nothing
      that appeared to hold out a promise of escape. The two boys
      shook the door violently; but it was firm on its hinges.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next Roy proposed to cut a way through it with his pocket
      knife.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'd be starved to death by the time you cut through that
      stuff," declared Jimsy.
    </p>
    <p>
      In proof of this he kicked the door, and the resulting sound
      showed that it was built of solid wood without any thin
      panels which might be cut through.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What next?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Peggy asked the question as the two perspiring lads stood
      perplexed without speaking or moving.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jiggered if I know," spoke Jimsy; "can't you or Roy think of
      anything?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We might try to batter the door down with that table,"
      suggested Roy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's worth trying. We've got to get out of here somehow."
    </p>
    <p>
      The two boys picked up the heavy, roughly made table and
      commenced a violent assault on the door. But although they
      dented it heavily, and sent some splinters flying, the portal
      held its own. At length they desisted from pure weariness.
      The situation looked hopeless.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It looks pretty bad," spoke Jimsy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It does indeed," agreed Roy. "Peggy, I wish we hadn't
      brought you along."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And why, pray, Roy Prescott?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, because&mdash;because, well, this isn't the sort of
      thing for a girl."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I guess if my brother can stand it I can," rejoined
      the girl, pluckily and in a firm voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, there's no use minimizing the fix we're in," declared
      Roy. "This is a lonesome bit of country. It may be a week
      before anyone will come around. We've just got to get out,
      that's all there is to it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish you'd solve the problem then," sighed Jimsy; "it's
      too much for me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll make another search of the premises, maybe we can
      stumble across something that may aid us. At any rate, it
      will give us something to do and keep our minds off the
      predicament we are in."
    </p>
    <p>
      Roy struck a match, of which he had a plentiful supply in his
      pockets. As the yellow flame sputtered up in the semi-gloom
      it showed every corner of the small hut. But it did not
      reveal anything that promised a chance to gain their liberty.
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once, just as the light was sputtering out, Peggy gave
      a cry. Her eye had been caught by a glistening metal object
      in one corner of the hut.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it?" asked Roy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A gun&mdash;a shot-gun standing in that corner over there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Huh!" sniffed Jimsy, "a lot of good that does us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "On the contrary," declared Peggy stoutly, "if it's loaded it
      may serve to get us free."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm from Missouri," declared Jimsy enigmatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's your idea, sis?" asked Roy, who knew that Peggy's
      ideas were usually worth following up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I remember reading only a short time ago of a man trapped
      much as we are who escaped by blowing off the lock of his
      prison with a gun he carried," replied Peggy; "maybe it would
      work in our case."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Maybe it would if&mdash;" rejoined Roy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If the gun was loaded, which is most unlikely."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, try it and see," urged Peggy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, do," echoed Jimsy; "Peggy's plan sounds like a good
      idea. Maybe some hunter left it here and the shells are still
      in it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No harm in finding out anyway," declared Roy.
    </p>
    <p>
      He struck another match and picked up the gun. It was an
      antique looking weapon badly-rusted. But on opening the
      breech he uttered a cry of joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good luck!" he exclaimed, "two shells,&mdash;one in each
      barrel."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, put it to the test," urged Jimsy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right. If this fails, though, I don't know what we'll
      do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't worry about that now. Try it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm going to. Don't get peevish."
    </p>
    <p>
      Roy crossed the room to the door. Raising the gun to his
      shoulder he placed the muzzle about opposite to where he
      thought the padlock must be located.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look out for a big noise, sis," he warned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peggy gave a little scream and raised her hands to her ears.
      She disliked firearms.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ready?" sang out Jimsy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All ready," came the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then fire!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Simultaneously with Jimsy's order came a deafening report. In
      that confined space it sounded as if a huge cannon had been
      fired. Roy staggered back under the "kick" of the heavy
      charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Once more," he announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again a sonorous report sounded, but this time a section of
      the door was blown right out of the framework. The daylight
      streamed in through it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now then for the test," cried Roy. "Come on, Jimsy."
    </p>
    <p>
      The two boys placed their shoulders to the door. With a
      suddenness that was startling, it burst open, and they faced
      freedom. The lock had been fairly driven from its hold by the
      twice repeated charge of shot.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young aviators were free once more. But it remained to be
      seen if the men who wished them harm had wrought their
      vengeance on the <i>Golden Butterfly</i>.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      WHAT'S TO BE DONE WITH THE WREN?
    </h3>
    <p>
      The <i>Golden Butterfly</i>, as an examination proved, had
      not been damaged during their imprisonment in the hut.
      Evidently, the men who had slammed the door and padlocked it
      had made off at top speed as soon as they had completed what
      they hoped would be a source of sore trouble to the young
      aviators.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now we'll fly back as agreed," declared Peggy merrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her spirits, almost down to zero in the hut, had recovered
      themselves marvellously in the fresh open air. She was
      radiant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I declare that the stay in the hut has done you good,"
      declared Jimsy, looking at her admiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Maybe it has&mdash;by contrast," returned Peggy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Like a sea trip," put in Roy. "I've heard that people who
      suffer from sea sickness are so much relieved when they get
      ashore that they imagine their good spirits are due to a
      change in their condition."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, that applies to me," returned Peggy; "I didn't think
      we'd get out of that hut so easily. How do you suppose that
      gun came to be there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The hunters who use the hut must have left it there,"
      rejoined Roy; "I wonder if they'll ever know how useful it
      was to us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "More likely they'll be mad when they find that the lock is
      blown off the door," laughed Jimsy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, so-long, folks, I'm going to start back in the auto,"
      declared Roy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'll beat you into town," challenged Jimsy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "More than likely, if the <i>Golden Butterfly</i> is doing
      her best," was the rejoinder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten minutes later the two machines were racing back to
      Meadville at almost top speed. Of course the speedy <i>Golden
      Butterfly</i> won, but then a vehicle of the air does not
      have to contend with the obstacles that a land conveyance
      does.
    </p>
    <p>
      They found Miss Prescott almost on the verge of hysterics. A
      garbled version of the events of the night had been brought
      to her and this, coupled with the long absence of the three
      young folks, had made her extremely nervous.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I declare, it seems as if you just can't keep out of
      trouble," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, it actually does seem so, I admit," confessed Peggy;
      "but we promise to be very good for the rest of the trip."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And never trouble trouble till trouble troubles us," chanted
      Jimsy airily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's all very well, but you keep me continually in
      suspense as to what you'll do next," almost wailed Miss
      Prescott. "We set out for a quiet trip and encounter nothing
      but troubles&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Adventures, Aunt Sally," laughingly corrected Roy; "what is
      life without adventures?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I'm sure I don't know what young people are coming
      to," sighed Miss Prescott with resignation. "There's another
      thing, what are we to do with this little Wren?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We can't leave her here, that's certain," declared Peggy
      with vehemence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, indeed," echoed Jess and Bess, who were of the council.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then what are we to do with her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just tote her along, I suppose," rejoined Peggy; "poor
      little thing, she doesn't take up much room; besides, Jess
      thinks she's an heiress."
    </p>
    <p>
      They all laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must have had an overdose of Laura Jean Libby," declared
      Roy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Roy Prescott, you behave yourself," cried Jess, flushing up;
      "besides, she has a strawberry mark on her left arm."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My gracious, then she surely is a missing heiress,"
      exclaimed Jimsy teasingly; "all well-regulated missing
      heiresses have strawberry marks and almost always on their
      left arm."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at this juncture that a knock came at the door. A bell
      boy stood outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A gentleman to see you, sir," he said, handing Roy a card.
    </p>
    <p>
      On it was printed: "Mr. James Kennedy, Detective, Meadville
      Police Station."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Goodness, a real detective!" exclaimed Jess excitedly;
      "let's see him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You won't be much impressed I'm afraid," rejoined Roy with a
      smile at his recollection of the Meadville sleuths.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, doesn't he wear glasses, have a hawk-like nose and
      smoke a pipe?" inquired Bess.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And hunt up missing heiresses?" teasingly struck in Jimsy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, he's a very different sort of person. But hush! he's
      coming now."
    </p>
    <p>
      A heavy tread sounded in the hall and Mr. James Kennedy,
      Detective of the Meadville Police Force, stood before them.
      As Jimsy had said, he was not impressive as to outward
      appearance, although his fat, heavy face, and rather vacant
      eyes, might have concealed a giant intellect.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've investigated the case of the attempted burning of the
      stable last night," he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," exclaimed Roy eagerly. "Have you any suspicions as to
      who did it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The man shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As yet we have no clews," he declared, "and I don't think
      we'll get any."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's too bad," replied Roy, "but let me tell you something
      that may help you."
    </p>
    <p>
      The lad launched into a description of their adventures of
      the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That hut belongs to Luke Higgins, a respectable man who is
      out West at present," said the detective when Roy had
      finished. "He uses it as a sort of hunting box in the rabbit
      shooting season. He couldn't have had anything to do with
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd like to know his address so that I could write and thank
      him for leaving that gun there," declared Peggy warmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The detective shook his head solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I reckon you young folks had better stop skee-daddling round
      the country this way," he said with heavy conviction; "you'll
      only get into more trouble. Flying ain't natural no more than
      crowing hens is."
    </p>
    <p>
      With this he picked up his hat, and, after assuring them that
      he would find a clew within a short time, he departed,
      leaving behind him a company in which amusement mingled with
      indignation. In fact, so angry was Roy over the stupidity or
      ignorance of the Meadville police, that he himself set out on
      a hunt to detect the authors of the outrages upon the young
      aviators.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sole result of his inquiry however was to establish the
      fact that both Cassells had left town, closing their house
      and announcing that they would be gone for some time.
    </p>
    <p>
      As there was nothing further to be gained by remaining in
      Meadville, the entire party, after lunch, set out once more,
      a big crowd witnessing the departure of the a&euml;rial
      tourists.
    </p>
    <p>
      They flew fast, and as the roads were excellent the auto had
      no difficulty in keeping up with them. On through the
      afternoon they soared along, sometimes swooping low above an
      alluring bit of scenery and again heading their machines
      skyward in pure exuberance of spirits. Their troubles at
      Meadville forgotten, they flew their machines like sportive
      birds; never had any of them experienced more fully the joy
      of flight, the sense of freedom that comes from traveling
      untrammeled into the ether.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had passed above a small village and were flying low,
      those in the auto waving to them, when Peggy, in the
      <i>Golden Butterfly</i>, gave a sudden exclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, look," she shouted, "a flock of sheep, and right in the
      path of the auto."
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment all of them saw the sheep, a large flock,
      headed by a belligerent looking ram with immense horns. Jake,
      who was driving the car, slowed up as he approached the
      flock. The woolly herd, huddled together helplessly, made no
      effort to get out of the road. Behind them a man and a boy
      shouted and yelled vigorously, but with no more effect than
      to bunch the animals more squarely in the path of the
      advancing car.
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once, just as the car was slowed down to almost a
      walking pace, a big ram separated himself from the flock and
      actually rushed for the front seat of the car.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jake uttered a yell as the woolly creature gave him a hard
      butt, knocking him out of his seat. But this wasn't all.
    </p>
    <p>
      By some strange freak the animal had landed in the car in a
      sitting posture. Now the young aviators roared with laughter
      to behold the creature seated in Jake's forcibly vacated
      place. Its hoofs rested on the driving wheel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Forward plunged the car, its queer driver with his feet
      wedged in the spokes of the steering wheel. Aloft the flock
      of young aviators roared with laughter at the sight. It was
      the oddest experience they had yet had&mdash;this spectacle
      of a grave-looking, long-horned ram driving an auto, while
      Jake prudently kept out of reach of those horns. As for Miss
      Prescott and The Wren, they cowered back in the tonneau in
      keen alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!" cried Peggy suddenly, "there comes a runabout; that ram
      will surely collide with it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A runabout coming in the opposite direction dashed round a
      corner of the country road at this juncture. The driver was a
      young girl, but she was veiled and her features could not be
      seen under the thick face covering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apparently the ram saw the other car coming, for the animal
      actually appeared to make a halfway intelligent effort to
      steer the car out of the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      For her part the girl in the runabout swerved her car from
      side to side in a struggle to avoid a collision, which
      appeared inevitable.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stop it!" shrieked Bess; "she'll be killed."
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      A RAMBUNCTIOUS RAM.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The ram evidently saw the other car coming; it tried to leap
      out but its hoofs were jammed in the spokes of the steering
      wheel. Before Jake could pick himself up from the floor of
      the front part of the car there came a loud shriek from the
      runabout. It was echoed by Miss Prescott and The Wren.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crash!
    </p>
    <p>
      The two cars came together with a fearful jolt.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eyes of the young aviators aloft were fixed on the scene.
      They saw the large car strike the runabout and crumple its
      engine hood. Peggy gave a scream.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ram, jolted out of its seat by the force of the
      collision, fell out to one side, allowing Jake to resume
      control of the wheel. But the runabout! It was ditched, its
      unfortunate occupant being pitched headlong into a ditch at
      the side of the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down swept the a&euml;roplanes, and there was a wild rush to
      the rescue. Peggy, Jess and Bess ran to the side of the
      injured occupant of the strange runabout. The boys divided
      themselves, attending to everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Roy! Roy! hurry, she's unconscious!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The cry came from Peggy as she rushed to the side of the
      young motorist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roy was not far off, and, at his sister's cry, he hastened to
      her side. Peggy had the girl's head in her lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Get water!" she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Jimsy was already on hand with a collapsible aluminum cup
      full of water from a near by spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, the poor dear," sighed Peggy, "to think that our fun
      should have&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      The strange girl opened her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who are you?" she exclaimed. "Where is my machine?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never mind for a minute," spoke Peggy, seeing that Jimsy and
      Jake were trying to drag the machine out of the ditch, "we'll
      fix it, never fear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, my head!" groaned the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That pesky ram," exploded Roy angrily; "let me help you up
      into the road, you'll be more comfortable."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, thank you, I can stand," came faintly from the injured
      girl. "I&mdash;am&mdash;much better now. What happened?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why a sort of volunteer driver was experimenting with our
      car, and I guess he made a mistake in driving," smilingly
      explained Roy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, that ram!" cried the girl half hysterically. "I thought
      I had a nightmare at first."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't blame you," smiled Peggy, "seeing a ram driving a
      motor car is apt to give one such ideas."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you really better?" asked Jess sympathetically as she
      came up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Peggy, get my smelling salts out of the traveling bag!"
      cried Miss Prescott anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      The accident had disturbed her sadly. The only unperturbed
      one in the party was Jake. He took things with philosophical
      calm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Knew more trouble was comin'," said he, and contented
      himself by dismissing the situation with that.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've got good news for you," said Jimsy, coming up; "your
      car isn't hurt a bit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, good!" cried the girl, clasping her hands and flushing.
      Her veil was raised now and they saw that she was very
      blonde, very pretty and just now very pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My, what a rambunctious ram!" punned Roy; "he ramified all
      over, didn't he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gracious, for a time I thought I was seeing things!" gasped
      the girl, who was seated on a tufted hummock of grass at the
      side of the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And then you felt them," laughed Jimsy. "That's the way such
      things run."
    </p>
    <p>
      They all laughed. Soon after, Roy, Jimsy and Jake dragged the
      small runabout out of the ditch. In the meantime Peggy had
      introduced herself and Jess to the young girl. The latter's
      name was Lavinia Nesbitt. She lived not far from the scene of
      the accident, and had been taking a jaunt in her machine.
    </p>
    <p>
      The runabout had been rescued, and the whole party introduced
      and talking merrily when Jess set up a cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Goodness! here comes that ram again!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Down the road, with the two sheep drivers at its heels, the
      beast was indeed coming. It advanced at a hard gallop, with
      head lowered and formidable horns ready for a charge, into
      the midst of the group.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look out for him!" yelled the sheep herders.
    </p>
    <p>
      They needed no second injunction. All skipped adroitly out of
      the path of the oncoming beast, which was rushing on like a
      whirlwind. Jimsy proved equal to the emergency. From his
      a&euml;roplane he took the rope which had already done good
      service in rescuing the <i>Golden Butterfly</i> from the
      pond. He formed it into a loop&mdash;the lariat of the
      Western plains.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now we've got him!" he exclaimed; "that is, if we are
      careful. But watch out!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No danger of that," responded Peggy, from the vantage of the
      tonneau of the car; "but how are you going to rope him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Watch!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimsy began swinging his loop in ever widening circles. The
      ram was now within a few feet of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, the <i>Dart</i>!" shrieked Bess; "he'll go right through
      it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed it did appear as if the maddened animal would. But
      just as there are many slips between cup and lip so there are
      many slips between the ram and the a&euml;roplane.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as it appeared that he would plow his way right through
      the delicate fabric, Jimsy hurled his loop. It settled round
      the animal's horns. Planting his heels in the ground Jimsy
      held tight to the rope. The next minute he "snubbed" it tight
      and the ram lost its feet and rolled over and over in the
      dust.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jake and Roy rushed in and completed the job of tying the
      creature.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Goodness, Jimsy, you're a regular broncho buster!" cried
      Peggy admiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I learned to do some tricks with a rope with the horse
      hunters out in Nevada," was the response.
    </p>
    <p>
      But careless as his manner was, Jimsy's eyes glowed with
      triumph. It was plainly to be seen that he was delighted with
      his success. Just then the two sheep drivers came running up.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girls looked rather alarmed. Suppose they should blame
      them for trying to kidnap the ram.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll do the talking," declared Roy; "if you said anything,
      Jimsy, there might be a row."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right," laughed Jimsy, regarding his "roped and tied
      captive." "I suppose you are an expert on dealing with ram
      owners."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I'm on to their mental ramifications," laughed Roy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sheep driver, an elderly man, accompanied by a youth,
      came up to them now. He touched his hat civilly as he
      approached.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good afternoon. No one hurt, I hope," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girls looked greatly relieved. After all, the man was not
      rude or angry as they had feared.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no, thank you," cried Jess, before Roy or Jimsy could
      open their mouths. "I hope he isn't though."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hurt!" exclaimed the ram's owner, "why you couldn't hurt him
      with a steam hammer. Why, day 'afore yesterday the blame
      thing went for my wife. Hoofs and horns&mdash;yes, sir! Most
      knocked her down, he did. I'll fix him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's his name?" asked Bess.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hannibal," said the man, without the flicker of a facial
      muscle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should think Cannonball would be a better name for him,"
      struck in Jimsy, with that funny, serious face he always
      assumed when 'joshing'.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir, I guess it <i>would</i> be more appropriate at
      that," assented the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at the disabled machine.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Busted?" he asked with apparent concern.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To some extent," rejoined Roy, "only, except for that engine
      hood being dented there doesn't appear to be much the matter
      with it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Glad to pay if there be," said the sheep driver. "I'm going
      ter git rid of ther pesky critter. He's cost me a lot in
      damage suits already."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why don't you put him on the stage as the boxing ram, or
      something like that?" inquired Jimsy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Might be a good scheme," said the man, as if considering the
      proposal seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mary had a little ram&mdash;" laughed Jimsy; who was
      thereupon told not to be "horrid."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why don't you box the nasty thing's ears for riding in our
      car?" asked Roy of Peggy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd like to do something, the saucy thing," declared Peggy
      with vehemence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell you what! Let's buy him."
    </p>
    <p>
      The suggestion came from Jimsy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, and have his skin made up into an auto robe," suggested
      Roy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you boys aren't ridiculous," cried Peggy; "I want to
      forget the incident, and so I'm sure does Lavinia," the name
      of the girl who had been spilled out of her machine.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may be sure I do," she declared with emphasis. "I was
      never so scared in my life."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Want to buy him?" asked the man, grasping at a chance of
      selling an animal that had already placed him in some
      embarrassing positions.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How much do you want?" asked Roy, more as a joke than
      anything else.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Three dollars," said the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There you are, girls! Who'll bid? Who'll bid? This fine
      young ram going at a sacrifice."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimsy imitated an auctioneer, raising his voice to a sharp
      pitch.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      AN INVITATION TO RACE.
    </h3>
    <p>
      It is almost needless to say that the purchase was not
      consummated. The girls raised a chorus of protest. The "nasty
      thing" was the mildest of the epithets they applied to the
      beast.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I don't know. I thought we might have his skin done
      into a robe. We could give it as a prize to the girl that
      makes the best record on this motor flight," suggested Jimsy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish you'd take him up a thousand feet and drop him,"
      declared the unfortunate ram's owner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor thing! he only acted according to his nature," defended
      Peggy; "let him loose and he'll go back to the flock."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not him," declared his owner; "he'd only raise more Cain.
      Better let him be."
    </p>
    <p>
      But the girls raised a chorus of protest. It was a shame to
      leave the poor thing tied up, and they insisted that he be
      let loose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right, if you kin stand it I kin," grinned the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      He and the boy bent over the captive ram and cast him loose.
      The beast struggled to his feet, and for an instant stood
      glaring about him out of his yellowish eyes that gleamed like
      agates. But it was only for an instant that he remained thus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he lowered his head and without more preliminaries
      dashed right at the <i>Golden Butterfly</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gracious, he's a game old sport!" yelled Jimsy; "Hasn't had
      enough of it yet, eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Right at the <i>Butterfly</i> the ram rushed. Reaching it,
      with one bound he was in the chassis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now we'll get him," whispered the owner of the ram. "I told
      you if he was let go he'd start cutting up rough."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you surely proved a good prophet," laughed Jimsy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now we've got to catch him," said the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How?" whispered Jimsy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Someone must lasso him as you did before. Easy now. Don't
      scare him or he might do damage."
    </p>
    <p>
      The ram was seated in the a&euml;roplane for all the world as
      if he was a scientific investigator of some sort. He paid no
      attention whatever to those who were creeping up on him,
      Jimsy with his rope in his hand, the loop trailing behind him
      all ready for action.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is more fun than a deer hunt!" declared Roy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Than a bull fight, you mean," retorted Jimsy; "this creature
      gives the best imitation of a wild bull I ever saw."
    </p>
    <p>
      They all laughed. The ram certainly had given a realistic
      interpretation of a savage Andalusian fighter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now then," whispered the sheep driver as they drew near.
      Jimsy's rope swirled and settled about the ram's horns. But
      the startled beast was due to give them another surprise.
      Hardly had Jimsy's rope fallen about it when with a snort it
      leaped clean in the air and out of the a&euml;roplane. It
      tore like an express train straight at Jimsy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the boy could get out of its path "Biff!" the impact
      had come. Jimsy arose into the atmosphere and described a
      distinct parabola. He landed with a bump in a clump of
      bushes, while Mr. Ram rushed off down the road to join his
      flock.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Haw! haw! haw!" roared the sheep man; "ain't hurt, be you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; but I've a good mind to sue you for damages," rejoined
      Jimsy, picking himself out of the clump of brush; "you've no
      right to drive an animal like that around the country without
      labeling him 'Dynamite. Dangerous'."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Guess I will, too," said the man, who appeared to think well
      of the suggestion; "he sure will get me in a pile of trouble
      one of these days."
    </p>
    <p>
      He raised his hat and strode off, followed by the boy. In the
      distance the ram was capering about among the other sheep.
      Jimsy brushed the dust off himself and then looked about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Anybody laughing?" he demanded suspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      They all shook their heads, the girls biting their lips to
      avoid smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right then, I suggest that we get out of here right
      away; a tiger's liable to come striding out of those woods
      next."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; we'd better be getting along; Millbrook, our next stop,
      is several miles off," said Peggy, consulting the map.
    </p>
    <p>
      No further time was lost in resuming their rapid flight. In
      the distance, as the flock of a&euml;roplanes arose, the
      sheep man waved his hat and shouted his adieus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Millbrook was reached that evening just at dusk. It proved to
      be a fair-sized town, and the a&euml;roplanes excited as much
      curiosity there as they had in Meadville&mdash;more so, in
      fact, for, from some flaring posters, it appeared that an
      a&euml;roplane exhibition and race had been arranged for the
      next day by a traveling company of aviators. That evening, at
      the hotel, a deputation of citizens waited on the boys and
      asked them if they would not prolong their stay and take part
      in the air sports. The mayor, whose name was Jasper Hanks,
      mentioned a prize of five hundred dollars for an endurance
      flight as a special inducement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lads said they would think things over and report in the
      morning. Their real object in delaying their decision was, of
      course, to consult the girls about appearing. Peggy, Jess and
      Bess went into raptures over the idea, and Miss Prescott's
      consent was readily obtained.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll be glad to rest for a day after all our exciting
      times," she declared, "and I mean to add to Wren's outfit
      too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, how good you are to me," sighed the odd little figure,
      nestling close to her benefactress.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tush! tush, my dear! I'm going to make a wonderful girl out
      of you," beamed the kindly lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      Descending to the office to buy some postcards, the boys
      found, lounging about the desk, a stoutish man with a rather
      dissipated face, puffy under the eyes and heavy about the
      jaws. A bright red necktie and patent-leather boots with
      cloth tops accentuated the decidedly "noisy" impression he
      conveyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the boys came down he eyed them sharply. Then he addressed
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My name's Lish Kelly," he said. "I'm manager of the United
      Aviators' Exhibition Company. We're showing out at the City
      Park tomorrow. I understand that you kids have been asked to
      butt in."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We've been asked to participate, if that's what you mean,"
      rejoined Roy rather sharply. The fellow's manner was
      offensive and overbearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, see here, you stay out," rejoined the man, shaking a
      fat forefinger on which glistened a diamond ring of such
      proportions as to make it dubious if it boasted a genuine
      stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You stay out of it," he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roy and Jimsy were almost dumfounded. The man's tone was one
      of actual command.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why? Why should we stay out of it?" demanded Roy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The mayor of the town has asked us to take part," came from
      Jimsy; "what have you got to do with it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's this way," said the man in rather a less overbearing
      way than he had hitherto adopted; "we're going about the
      country giving flights. The city gives us the park in this
      town and we get so much of the receipts. But we rely on
      winning the prizes, see. Now if you kids butt in, why you
      might win some of them and that knocks my profit out. Get
      me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I understand you, if that's what you mean," rejoined Roy;
      "but I still fail to see why we should not compete if we want
      to."
    </p>
    <p>
      The man placed his hand on the boy's shoulder impressively.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Cos if you do it'll make trouble for you, sonny."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who'll make it?" flashed back Roy indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will, son, and I'm some trouble maker when I start
      anything along them lines, take it from me."
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned on his heel, stuck his cigar at a more acute angle
      in the side of his mouth, and strode off, leaving the two
      boys dumfounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, what do you make of that?" demanded Roy, as soon as
      his astonishment had subsided a trifle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just this, that Mr. Lish Kelly thinks he can run this thing
      to suit himself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What will we do about it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "For my part I wanted to compete before. I desire to more
      than ever now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Same here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Maybe he was only bluffing after all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Maybe; but just the same I wouldn't trust him not to try to
      do us some harm. As he says, his main profits come from
      winning the prizes offered by the different communities."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Humph! well, so far as that goes, I don't see why that need
      keep us out of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor I; but we've had troubles enough, and I don't want
      willingly to run into any more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor I. Well, let's sleep on it. We'll decide in the
      morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's a good idea."
    </p>
    <p>
      The two lads went up to bed and slept as only healthy lads
      can. The next morning dawned bright and clear. There was
      hardly any wind. It was real "flying" weather. The
      a&euml;roplanes had been sheltered in a big shed belonging to
      the hotel. Before breakfast the boys went out and looked them
      over. All were in good shape.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they were coming out of the shed they were hailed by no
      less a personage than Mayor Hanks.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said he, "are you going to fly?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We think of doing so," said Roy, hesitating a little. He
      wanted to speak of the conduct of Lish Kelly, but on second
      thought he decided not to; the man might merely have had a
      fit of bad temper on him. His threats might have been only
      empty ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you're going to fly I have got some entry blanks with
      me," said the mayor. "I wish you'd sign 'em."
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew out a bunch of blue papers with blanks for describing
      the name of the machine, its power, driver and other details.
    </p>
    <p>
      This decided the boys.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right, we'll enter all our machines," said Roy; "let us
      go into the writing room and we'll sign the entry blanks."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good for you," cried the mayor delightedly; "you'll be a big
      drawing card, especially the young ladies. I never heard of
      gals flyin', although, come to think of it, why shouldn't
      they?"
    </p>
    <p>
      In the writing room they concluded the business. When it was
      done all the machines had been entered in every contest,
      including an altitude one.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We start at ten sharp, so be there," admonished the mayor as
      he departed, highly pleased at having secured quite a flock
      of young aviators at no cost at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was as his figure vanished, that Lish Kelly crossed the
      writing room. He had been sitting in a telephone booth, and
      leaving the door a crack open had heard every word that had
      passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He greeted the boys with an angry scowl.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So you ain't going to stay out?" he said gruffly, as he
      passed. "All right; look out for squalls!"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Gracious, are we in for more trouble?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimsy looked blankly at Roy; but the latter only laughed at
      his chum's serious face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somehow, viewed in the bright light of early day, Lish
      Kelly's threats did not appear nearly as formidable as they
      had over night.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nonsense; what harm can he do us anyhow? We're going to go
      into this race, and we're going to win too. Just watch us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Going to tell the girls anything about Kelly and his
      remarks?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; what good would that do? It would only scare them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's so, too; but just the same I didn't like the look of
      Kelly's face when he came through."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He looked to me like a bulldog that had swallowed a baby's
      boot and didn't like the taste of the blacking on it,"
      laughed Roy.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this juncture the girls came into the room. All were
      radiant and smiling in anticipation of the day's sport.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, we've been and gone and done it," announced Roy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Done what?" demanded Peggy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Signed the paperrr-r-r-s," was the rejoinder, rendered with
      great dramatic effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      He waved the duplicate entry blanks above his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let's see them," begged Jess.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right. Look what I've let us in for!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why&mdash;why&mdash;good gracious, Roy, you've got us down
      for everything," gasped Peggy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's right, all the way across from soup to nuts," struck
      in the slangy Jimsy.
    </p>
    <p>
      They all laughed. The color rose in the girls' faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If only we can win some of them," cried Jess.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, the machines are all in fine shape. If we don't win it
      will be because the other fellows have better machines."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where are the aviation grounds?" inquired Bess.
    </p>
    <p>
      "At the City Park, about a mile out of town to the south. We
      can get to it by looking down at the trolley tracks," said
      Roy, who had consulted the mayor on this point.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you are going to fly out there?" asked Miss Prescott,
      who was also by this time a party to the conference.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course; and, by the way, we ought to be getting out there
      pretty soon; I want to be looking over the grounds and
      selecting the best places for landing and so on," said Roy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, please don't get into any more scrapes," sighed Miss
      Prescott; "what with gipsies, firebugs and rams, our trip has
      been quite exciting enough for me."
    </p>
    <p>
      The boys exchanged glances. If the man Kelly tried to carry
      out his threats things might be more exciting yet, they
      thought. But both kept their knowledge to themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was arranged that Miss Prescott should motor out to the
      City Park. Soon thereafter the young aviators placed
      finishing touches on their machines, and while a curious
      crowd gathered they took to the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Looks just like a flock of pigeons," said a man in the
      crowd, as they climbed skyward quite closely bunched.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It sure does," agreed his companion, "but them things is
      prettier than any flock of pigeons I ever see."
    </p>
    <p>
      And this opinion was echoed by many of the throng. At any
      rate everyone who saw the a&euml;roplanes start made up his
      or her mind to pay a visit to the park and see some more
      extended flights, so that Mayor Hanks' prediction was
      verified.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the young aviators hovered above City Park for a short
      space of time, and then dropped earthward, a veritable
      sensation was created. From a row of "hangars" mechanicians
      and aviators came running. One or two aviators who were aloft
      practicing "stunts," dropped swiftly to earth. Lish Kelly's
      troupe was a large one, consisting of five men and one woman
      flyer, the wife of Carlos Le Roy, a Cuban aviator.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside the grounds several of the frugal individuals who
      desired to see the flights without paying admission also
      watched as the quintette of strange a&euml;roplanes dropped
      to earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      One by one the graceful craft of the air settled to the
      ground, and the young aviators alighted. Members of the
      Arrangement Committee hastened to their sides, shaking hands
      warmly and thanking them for their interest in the coming
      contests.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Kelly aviators gazed curiously, some of them resentfully,
      at the newcomers. They had all the professional's antipathy
      and jealousy of amateur performers. As the Arrangement
      Committee bustled off after telling our friends to make
      themselves perfectly at home, Pepita Le Roy came up to them.
      She was a handsome woman, in a foreign way, with large, dark
      eyes and an abundance of raven black hair. She was rather
      flashily dressed and walked with a sort of swagger that in a
      vague way reminded Peggy of "Carmen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So you are zee girl aviators," she remarked, as she came up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; I guess that's what they call us," rejoined Peggy; "we
      enjoy flying and have done a lot of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So! I have read your names in zee papers."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, those awful papers!" cried Jess, who hated publicity;
      "they are always printing things about us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What! You do not like it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no! You see, we only fly for fun. Not as a business
      and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Peggy stopped short. She felt she had committed a grave
      breach of tactfulness. It was not the thing, she felt, to
      boast to a professional woman flyer of their standing as
      amateurs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor was the Cuban woman slow to take umbrage at what she
      considered an insult. Her eyes flashed indignantly as she
      regarded the fair-haired, slender girl before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So you fly only for fun," she said vehemently; "very well,
      you have all zee fun you want before to-day is ovaire."
    </p>
    <p>
      Without another word she walked off, with the swinging walk
      of her race.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girls looked at each other with a sort of amused dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Goodness, Peggy; you should be more careful," cried Bess;
      "you've hurt her feelings dreadfully."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sure I didn't mean to," declared Peggy remorsefully.
      "I&mdash;I had no idea that she would flare up like that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, after all, it doesn't matter much," soothed Jess,
      pouring oil on the troubled waters, so to speak. "I'm glad
      the boys didn't hear it though."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So am I. See, they're busy on Roy's machine," exclaimed
      Bess.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; the lower left wing is rather warped," explained Peggy;
      "they are fixing it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wonder who that man is who is monkeying with the <i>Red
      Dragon</i>?" said Peggy, the next instant. "I mean that
      horrid looking man in the check suit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know. See, he has a monkey wrench in his hand, too,"
      exclaimed Bess.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost simultaneously the boys looked round from their work
      on the biplane and saw the man. It was Lish Kelly. He was
      bending over the engine and doing something to it with his
      wrench.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hey! What are you doing there?" yelled Roy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just looking at your machine. No harm in that, is there?"
      demanded Kelly, with a red face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "None at all, except that we don't want our machines touched.
      How comes it you have that monkey wrench in your hands if you
      weren't tampering with the machinery?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimsy spoke in a voice that fairly bubbled over with
      indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't get sore, kid; I wouldn't harm your old mowing
      machine. There isn't one of mine but could beat it the
      fastest day it ever flew."
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke Kelly slouched off. They saw him go up to a group
      of his aviators and begin talking earnestly to them. Once or
      twice he motioned with his head in their direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So he <i>does</i> mean mischief, after all," said Roy;
      "let's take a good look at the <i>Dragon's</i> engine. He may
      have injured it, although I don't think he'd have had time to
      hurt it seriously."
    </p>
    <p>
      They strolled over to the <i>Dragon</i>, with the girls
      trailing behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!" cried Peggy, as they came up, "look at that spark
      plug."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's the matter with it?" demanded Jimsy,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look, it's all bent and twisted out of shape."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jove, sis, so it is. Your eyes are as sharp as they are
      pretty!" cried Roy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No compliments, please. Oh, that horrid man!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is he?" asked Jess. "You appeared to know him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, we had some conversation with him this morning,"
      laughed Roy; "but to return to the spark plug; it's a good
      thing we carry extra ones."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But we don't!" cried Jimsy, in a dismayed tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What! you had a supply in a locker on your machine."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimsy looked confused.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've got to make a confession," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You didn't bring them!" cried Peggy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, the fact is I&mdash;I forgot."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimsy looked miserably from one to the other. Here was a
      quandary indeed. It might prove hard to get such a commodity
      as a spark plug in Millbrook.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVIII.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      IN SEARCH OF A NEW PLUG.
    </h3>
    <p>
      It was while they were still discussing the situation that
      the automobile with Jake at the wheel and Miss Prescott and
      The Wren in the tonneau, drove into the grounds. What a
      difference there was in the child since her benefactors had
      fitted her out! She looked like a dainty, ethereal little
      princess instead of the ragged little waif that had been
      rescued from the gipsy camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the minds of our young friends were now intent on
      different matters. Time pressed. The altitude flight, in
      which Jimsy had planned to take part, was to be the first
      thing on the program. If anything was to be done about
      reequipping the <i>Dragon</i> it must be done quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell you what," said Roy suddenly, "we'll get into the car
      and drive back to town. It won't take long and maybe we can
      dig up an extra one some place."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If we don't I'm out of it for keeps," groaned Jimsy; "oh,
      that Kelly. I'd like to punch his head."
    </p>
    <p>
      He doubled up his fists aggressively; but, after all, what
      chance had he to prove that Kelly had actually damaged the
      plug. If confronted the man would have probably denied all
      knowledge of it. Nobody had actually seen him do it, so that
      positive proof was out of the question. No, they must repair
      the damage as best they could.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Roy determined to have the machines closely guarded. The
      situation was explained to Miss Prescott, and while she and
      her small prot&eacute;g&eacute; took seats in the grand stand
      Jake was detailed to guard the a&euml;roplanes. This done,
      the boys got into the machine and prepared to start for town.
      But the girls interfered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aren't you going to take us along, you impolite youths!"
      cried Bess.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, certainly, your company is always charming," returned
      Jimsy, with a low bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course it is, but you wouldn't have asked us to come if
      we had not invited ourselves," declared Peggy vehemently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How can you say so? Our lives would be a dry desert without
      the girl aviators to liven things up," declared Jimsy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jimsy Bancroft, if you are going to get poetical you'll
      leave this car," cried Jess.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's just it," declared Jimsy, "girls can cry their eyes
      out over romantic heroes, but when a regular fellow starts to
      get 'mushy' they go up in the air."
    </p>
    <p>
      Amidst the chorus of protestations aroused by this ungallant
      speech Roy started the car. Swiftly it sped out of the
      grounds; but not so swiftly that the keen eyes of Lish Kelly
      did not see it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He called Herman Le Roy, the Cuban aviator, to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Le Roy, you are not in the altitude contest," he said, "hop
      in my car with me and we'll follow those kids. They're up to
      something."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cuban looked at him and smiled, showing two rows of white
      teeth under his small, dapperly curled mustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think, Se&ntilde;or Kelly, you have been up to something
      yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you know what I told you. We want that
      five-hundred-dollar prize, Carlos, and by the looks of things
      if we don't do something those kids are likely to get it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They have fine machines," agreed the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; and they are equipped with a balancing device that
      makes them much more reliable than ours."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A balancing device!" exclaimed the Cuban, as the two men got
      into the car, a small yellow runabout of racy appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's what I said, and it's a good one, too. I read an
      account of it in an aviation paper; but the description was
      too sketchy for me to see how the thing was worked."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Those boys must be wonders."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm afraid they are. That's why we've got to be careful of
      them. But I've got a plan to fix them, the whole lot of
      them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll tell you as we go along."
    </p>
    <p>
      As the car rolled past the group of a&euml;roplanes with Jake
      faithfully standing guard over them, Kelly hailed him in a
      suave voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Any idea where the young folks have gone?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Jake, who had no idea that Kelly had a sinister motive in
      asking the question, replied readily enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, they've gone into Millbrook to get another spark plug.
      Something happened to one of the plugs of that red machine
      yonder."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right. Thanks."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kelly drove on.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know what happened to that plug, Carlos?" he asked,
      as they reached the open road and bowled forward at a good
      speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've got a pretty good guess. It was not altogether an
      accident, eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "An accident, well, it was, in a sense. I happened to be near
      that machine with a monkey wrench and in some way was
      careless enough to let it put that plug out of business."
    </p>
    <p>
      Both men laughed heartily, as if Kelly's rascally act had
      been the most amusing thing in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are a genius," declared Le Roy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I reckon I know a thing or two," was the modest
      response; "besides, I need that money."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what is your plan?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll tell you as we go along. Drive fast, but don't keep so
      close to that other car that they can get sight of us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not much fear of that. They had a long start of us and are
      out of sight now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So much the better. It doesn't interfere with my plans a
      bit, provided they take the same road back."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you good with a shovel?" was the cryptic reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't understand you, I must say."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will later on. We'll drive up to that farmhouse yonder."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, and what then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'll borrow two shovels."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Two shovels!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's what I said."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what on earth have two shovels to do with stopping a
      bunch of kids from entering in an a&euml;roplane race?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Carlos, your brain is dull to-day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It would take a wizard to understand what you intend to do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you will see later on. Drive in this gate. That's it,
      and now for the shovels."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE TRAP.
    </h3>
    <p>
      For more than half an hour eager inquiries were made in
      Millbrook for a spark plug such as they wanted. But all their
      search was to no avail. But suddenly, just as they were about
      to give up in despair, a man, of whom they had made
      inquiries, recalled that not far out of town there was a
      small garage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'll try there," determined Jimsy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finding out the road, they speeded to the place. It did not
      look very promising, a small, badly fitted up auto station,
      run by an elderly man with red-rimmed, watery eyes, looking
      out from behind a pair of horn spectacles that somehow gave
      him the odd look of a frog.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Got any spark plugs?" asked Jimsy, as the machine came to a
      halt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, all kinds," said the man, in a wheezy, asthmatic voice
      that sounded like the exhaust of a dying-down engine.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good!" cried Jimsy, hopping out of the car.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is, we will have all kinds next week," went on the man;
      "I've ordered 'em."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Goodness, then you haven't any right now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've got a few. Possibly you might find what you want among
      them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll try, anyway," declared Jimsy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man led the way into a dingy sort of shed. On a shelf in
      a dusty corner was a box.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can hunt through that," said the man wearily; "if you
      find what you want wake me up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wake you up?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I always take a sleep at this time of day. You woke me
      up when you came in. Now I'm going to doze off again."
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying he sank into a chair, closed his eyes and presently
      was snoring.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dead to the world!" gasped Jimsy; "well, that's the quickest
      thing in the sleep line I ever saw!"
    </p>
    <p>
      As it was no use to waste further time the boy began
      rummaging in the box. It contained all sorts of odds and
      ends, among them several plugs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll bet there isn't one here that will fit my engine!"
      grumbled Jimsy; "I don't&mdash;what! Yes! By Jiminy! Eureka!
      Hurray, I've found one!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The man woke up with a start.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's the matter?" he demanded drowsily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing! That is, everything!" cried Jimsy. "I've found just
      what I want."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right. Leave the money on that shelf there. It's a
      dollar."
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, off he went to sleep again, while Jimsy,
      overjoyed, hastily peeled a dollar from his "roll" and
      departed. The last sound he heard was the steady snoring of
      the garage man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, there's one fellow that money can't keep awake, even
      if it does talk," said Jimsy laughingly to himself as, with a
      cry of triumph, he rejoined the party, waving the plug like a
      banner or an emblem of victory.
    </p>
    <p>
      No time was lost in starting the auto up again and they
      whirled back through Millbrook in a cloud of dust. Passing
      through the village they retraced their way along the road by
      which they had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just half an hour before that altitude flight," remarked
      Jimsy to Roy, who was driving, as they sped through the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fine; we'll make it all right," was the rejoinder. Roy
      turned on more power and the auto shot ahead like some scared
      wild thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'll only hit the high spots this trip," declared Roy, as
      the machine plunged and rolled along at top speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once, as they turned a corner, they received a sudden
      check. Right ahead of them a man was driving some cows. Roy
      jammed down the emergency brake, causing them all to hold on
      for dear life to avoid being pitched out by the sudden change
      of speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wow! what a jolt!" exclaimed Jimsy; "it sure
      did&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      The sentence was never completed. The auto gave a pitch
      sideways and then plunged into a pit that had been dug across
      the road and covered with leaves and dust placed on a
      framework of branches. Down into this pit crashed the machine
      with a sickening jolt. The girls screamed aloud in fear. It
      appeared as if the machine would be a total wreck.
    </p>
    <p>
      But that was not the worst of it. In the sudden fall into the
      pit Roy had been pitched out and now lay quite still at the
      roadside. Jimsy had saved himself from being thrown by
      clutching tight hold of the seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped the engine and then clambering out of the car
      hastened to Roy's side. To his delight, just as he reached
      him, Roy sat up, and although his face was drawn with pain he
      declared that his injuries consisted of nothing more serious
      than a sprained ankle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But look at the machine!" cried Jimsy; "it's smashed, I'm
      sure of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      The pit which had been dug across the road was about three
      feet deep and the front wheels of the auto rested in it. The
      hind wheels had not entered, as the excavation was not a wide
      one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both boys hastened to examine the car. To their satisfaction
      they found that not much damage had been done beyond a slight
      wrenching of the steering gear. This was due to the fact that
      they had been going at reduced speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gracious! Suppose we had been coming along at the same pace
      we'd been hitting up right along," exclaimed Jimsy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We wouldn't be here now," declared Roy; "we'd be in the next
      county or thereabouts."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, we'd have kept right on going," agreed Jimsy; "talk
      about flying! But, say, who can have done this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not much doubt in my mind it's the work of that outfit of
      Kelly's. He told us to look out for trouble, and he appears
      to be making it for us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The precious rascal; he might have broken all our necks."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's true, if we'd been hitting up high speed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How are we going to get out of this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Peggy asked the question just as the man who had been driving
      the cattle came running up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's the trouble?" he asked, gazing at the odd scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can see for yourself," rejoined Roy; "some rascals dug a
      trench across the road so as to wreck our machine if
      possible."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Humph! So I see," was the rejoinder; "how be you goin' ter
      git out of thar?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's a problem. If we could get a team of
      horses&mdash;&mdash;" The man interrupted Roy, who was acting
      as spokesman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell you what, two of my cattle back thar are plow oxen.
      I'll go back to ther farm, git their yokes on 'em and yank
      you out of here. That is pervidin' you pay me, uv course."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't worry about that. We're willing to pay anything in
      reason."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right, then, I'll hook up Jeb and Jewel."
    </p>
    <p>
      The man walked back toward his cattle, which were contentedly
      browsing at the side of the road. Clucking in an odd manner,
      he drove two of them out of the herd and started back toward
      a farmhouse which was not far distant. In a wonderfully short
      time he was back with his oxen in harness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gee, Jeb! Haw, Jewel!" he cried, as he came up. The oxen
      swung round and the heavy chain attached to their yoke was
      hitched to the front axle of the car.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now for it!" cried Roy, when this had been done.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Git ap!" shouted the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      The slow but powerful oxen strained their muscular backs. The
      chain tightened and the next moment the car, from which Peggy
      and Jess and Bess had alighted, rose from the pit. Then the
      hind wheels dropped into it with a bump, but the shock
      absorbers prevented serious damage. With the oxen straining
      and pulling it was finally hauled into the road and they were
      ready to resume the trip.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roy rewarded their helper with a substantial bill, and they
      were all warm in their thanks.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Twasn't nuthin'," declared the man, "an' now I guess I'll
      go to ther house and have my hired man fill in this road.
      Things is come to a fine pass when such things kin happen."
    </p>
    <p>
      As the rescued party sped on toward the aviation field they
      fully agreed with the rustic's opinion. Had it not been for
      sheer luck they would have suffered extremely serious
      consequences as the result of a rascal's device. But as it
      was Kelly's plot against them appeared to have failed.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XX.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      AN ATTACK IN THE AIR.
    </h3>
    <p>
      "B-o-o-m!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The sound of a gun crashed out as the auto sped through the
      gates of the aviation field and rapidly skimmed across to
      where the a&euml;roplanes had been parked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just in time!" cried Peggy; "that's the five-minute warning
      gun."
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time the grandstand was well filled and a band was
      playing lively airs. At the starting line three of the Kelly
      a&euml;roplanes were gathered ready for the signal for the
      start of the altitude flight. The instant the car came to a
      standstill Jimsy was out and in a jiffy had the new spark
      plug adjusted. There was no time to test it, but he felt
      pretty confident that it would work all right.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All ready!" shouted the official in charge of the starting
      arrangements.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ready!" rejoined Jimsy heartily, as he adjusted his leather
      helmet and Jake and Roy started the engine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kelly, whose back had been turned while he talked to some of
      his troup, faced round at the sound of the boy's voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What, you here!" he choked out, his face purple.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; do you know any reason why I shouldn't be?" asked
      Jimsy, with meaning emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the lad's direct gaze Kelly's eyes fell. He couldn't
      face the lad, but turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There, if that isn't proof of his guilt I'd like to know
      what is," declared Jimsy to Roy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But the rascal covered up his tracks so cleverly that we
      can't prove anything on him," muttered Roy disgustedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same instant the starting bomb boomed out. The crowd
      yelled, and the drummer of the band pounded his instrument
      furiously. Above the uproar sounded the sharp, crackerlike
      report of the motors. As more power was applied they roared
      like batteries of Gatling guns.
    </p>
    <p>
      Into the air shot one of them, a black biplane. It was
      followed by the others, two monoplanes and a triplane. Jimsy
      ascended last, but as this was not a race, but a
      cloud-climbing contest, he was in no hurry. He was anxious to
      see what the other air craft could do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up they climbed, ascending the a&euml;rial stairway, while
      the crowd below stared up, at the risk of stiff necks in the
      immediate future.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimsy chose spiraling as his method of rising. But the others
      went upward in curious zigzags. This was because their
      machines were not equipped with the stability device, and
      they could not attempt the same tactics. Before long Jimsy
      was high above the others. From below he appeared a mere dot
      in the blue. But still he flew on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once he glanced at his barograph. It showed he had ascended
      5,000 feet. It was higher than the boy had ever been before,
      but he kept perseveringly on.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was cold up there in the regions of the upper air, and
      Jimsy found himself wishing he had put on a sweater.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's too long a drop to go down and get one," he remarked to
      himself, with grim humor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beneath him he could see the other a&euml;roplanes; but the
      black one was the only one that appeared to be a serious
      rival. The rest did not seem to be trying very hard to reach
      a superlative height. The black machine, however, was
      steadily rising. After a while Jimsy could see the face of
      its occupant. It was the Cuban, Le Roy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, what's he trying to do, I wonder?" thought Jimsy, as
      the black biplane rose to the same level as himself and
      appeared to be going through some odd maneuvering.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's mighty funny," mused the boy, watching his rival; "I
      can't make out what he's up to."
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed the black biplane was behaving queerly. Now it would
      swoop toward Jimsy and then would dart, only to return.
      Suddenly it came driving straight at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was then that Jimsy suddenly realized what his rival was
      trying to do. To use a slangy but expressive phrase, Le Roy,
      the veteran aviator, was trying to rattle the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So that's his game, is it," thought Jimsy; "well, I'll give
      him a surprise."
    </p>
    <p>
      Manipulating his spark and gas levers the boy gave his
      graceful red craft full power. The Dragon shot sharply
      upward, crossing Le Roy's machine about twenty feet above its
      upper plane. Jimsy laughed aloud at the astonished expression
      on the man's face as he skimmed above him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I reckon he'll think that I do know something about driving
      an a&euml;roplane, after all," he chuckled as he rose till
      his barograph recorded 6,000 feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beneath him he could see Le Roy starting to descend.
      Something appeared to be wrong with the black biplane's
      motor. It acted sluggishly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, as he's going down I guess I will, too," said Jimsy to
      himself; "6,000 feet is by no means a record, but it's high
      enough for me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he was plunged into what appeared to be a wet and
      chilly fog. In reality it was a cloud that had drifted in on
      him. It grew suddenly cold with an almost frosty chill. The
      moisture of the cloud drenched him to the skin. The lad
      shivered and his teeth chattered, but he kept pluckily to his
      task.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before long he emerged into the sunlight once more. The crowd
      which had thrilled when the young aviator vanished into the
      vapor set up a yell when he reappeared. But at the height he
      was Jimsy, of course, did not hear it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as he dropped lower the shouts and cheers became plainly
      audible. The lad waved his hand in acknowledgment. Then, as
      he neared the ground, he put his machine through a series of
      graceful evolutions that set the crowd wild.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The altitude flight is won by Number Four," announced the
      officials after they had examined the barograph; "with a
      height of 6,000 feet. Number Four is Mr. James Bancroft."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gee; that sounds real dignified," laughed Jimsy; "it's a
      treat to be treated with becoming dignity once in a while."
    </p>
    <p>
      The next flight was a race six times round the course. This
      was won by one of the Kelly flyers. Then came an endurance
      contest which Roy captured handily and some exhibition flying
      in which Bess did some clever work and was delighted to find
      herself a winner.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was soon after this that the gun was fired as a note of
      warning that the big race was about to begin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peggy's <i>Golden Butterfly</i> and Roy's entry, the <i>Red
      Dragon</i>, borrowed for this race because the biplane was
      too heavy and clumsy for such fast work, were wheeled to the
      starting line. Already three of Kelly's machines were there,
      among them being that of Se&ntilde;ora Le Roy, or, as she was
      billed, the Cuban Skylark, the Only Woman Flyer in the World.
      It appeared now that she had small claim to the title. The
      crowd set up a cheer for her as she took her seat in a
      neat-looking monoplane of the Bleriot type.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when Peggy's dapper figure, smartly attired in her
      aviation costume, appeared a still louder shout went up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kelly scowled blackly. He stepped up to his flyers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've got to win this race or get fired," he snarled.
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXI.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      PEGGY'S SPLENDID RACE.
    </h3>
    <p>
      "They're off!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hurrah!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There they go!"
    </p>
    <p>
      These and hundreds of other cries and exclamations followed
      the report of the starting gun. The Cuban woman flyer was off
      first, then came two other of the professional flyers, while
      Roy and Peggy got away last.
    </p>
    <p>
      The race was to be sixty miles out to a small body of water
      called Lake Loon and return. A trolley line ran past the
      aviation grounds and out to the lake. For the guidance of the
      flyers a car with a huge American flag flying from it blazed
      a trail below them, as it were.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roy's craft gained a slight lead on the <i>Golden
      Butterfly</i> and two of the Kelly flyers were soon passed by
      both the boy and his sister. But the professional woman flyer
      still maintained her lead. Second came another of Lish
      Kelly's aviators in a blue machine. This was Ben Speedwell,
      who enjoyed quite a reputation as a skillful and daring air
      driver.
    </p>
    <p>
      The flyers had all struck a level about 1,500 feet in the
      air. There was a light head wind, but not enough to deter any
      of the powerfully engined craft. Glancing back for an instant
      Roy saw one of the contesting aviators dropping to earth. His
      companion soon followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Overheated engines probably," thought the boy; "I must be
      careful the same thing doesn't happen to me going at this
      pace."
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly another a&euml;roplane loomed up beside him. It was
      the <i>Golden Butterfly</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good for you, sis!" cried Roy, as Peggy, waving her hand,
      roared past. In another minute she had shot past Speedwell,
      but the leader, the woman flyer, was still some distance
      ahead, and appeared to steadily maintain the lead she had.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last Lake Loon came into view. It was a more or less
      shallow body of water with a small island in the middle of
      it. As they neared it Speedwell and Roy were flying almost
      abreast, with Speedwell just a shade in the lead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Speedwell made a spurt and shot ahead of the
      <i>Dragon</i>. At a distance of half a mile from Roy, who was
      now last, Speedwell was above the lake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peggy and the woman flyer had already turned and were on
      their way back, with the latter still in the lead. Roy was
      watching Speedwell intently.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw the man bank his machine to take the curve in order to
      round the lake. An appalling climax followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's turned too sharp. He'll never make it," exclaimed Roy,
      holding his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      The a&euml;roplane swayed madly. Then began a fierce fight on
      Speedwell's part to settle it on an even keel. But skillful
      as he was he could not master the overbalanced machine.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is lost!" breathed Roy, every nerve athrill.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then the next minute:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cracky! He's got it. No, he's falling again&mdash;ah!"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a note of horror in the exclamation. The
      a&euml;roplane in front of Roy dived wildly, then fairly
      somersaulted. The strain was too great. A wing parted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's the end of him!" exclaimed Roy, in a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down shot the broken a&euml;roplane with the velocity of
      lightning. It just dodged the trees on the little island and
      then it plunged into the lake, first spilling Speedwell out.
      Then down on top of him came the smother of canvas, wood and
      wires.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He'll be suffocated if I don't go to his rescue," murmured
      Roy; "it will put me out of the race, but I must save him."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a clear spot on the island, and toward this the boy
      dived. In the meantime men were putting out from shore in a
      small boat. But the boy knew that they could not reach the
      unfortunate Speedwell in time to save his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roy made a clever landing on the island and then lost no time
      in wading out to the half floating, half submerged wreckage.
      In the midst of it lay Speedwell. Roy dragged him ashore. The
      man's face was purple, his limbs limp and lifeless and he
      choked gaspingly. Another minute in the water would have been
      his last, as Roy realized.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did what he could for the man, rolling him on his face to
      get out the water he had swallowed. By this time the boat
      from the shore landed on the island. The two men got out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is he alive?" they asked of Roy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, and he'll get better, too, I guess. Lucky he fell in
      the water. No limbs are broken."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you're a pretty decent sort of fellow to get out of
      the race to help an injured man," said one of the men.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I'll leave him to you now," rejoined Roy; "is there a
      hospital near here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's one 'bout a mile away. We can phone for an
      ambulance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good! Well, good-bye."
    </p>
    <p>
      With a whirr and a buzz the boy was gone, and speedily became
      a speck in the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime the aviation field was in an uproar. Dashing
      toward it had come the two leading a&euml;roplanes. From dots
      in the sky no bigger than shoe buttons they speedily became
      manifest as two a&euml;roplanes aquiver with speed. Blue
      smoke poured from their exhausts. Evidently the two aviators
      were straining their craft to the utmost.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's that Cuban woman and the young girl flyer!" yelled a
      man who had a pair of field glasses.
    </p>
    <p>
      The uproar redoubled. The two a&euml;roplanes were almost
      side by side as they rushed onward. Which would win the $500
      race?
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a struggle that had begun some miles back. After
      leaving the lake Peggy, who had held some speed in reserve
      while her opponent had keyed her machine to its top pitch,
      had gradually gained on her. But still there was a gap
      between the two a&euml;roplanes.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the return trip no car blazed the way. The speed was too
      great for that. For this reason smudges, or smoky fires, had
      been lighted to guide the flyers. At a place where it was
      necessary to make a slight turn Peggy made the gain that
      brought her almost alongside her competitor. In making the
      turn the monoplane flown by the Cuban aviatrix could not
      negotiate it at as sharp an angle as Peggy's machine, owing
      to its not being equipped with an equalizing, or stability
      device.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now it was that Peggy tensioned up the <i>Golden
      Butterfly</i> to its full power. The engine fairly roared as
      the propeller blurred round. The whole fabric trembled under
      the strain. It seemed as if nothing made by man could stand
      the pressure.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the <i>Golden Butterfly</i> had been built by one of the
      foremost young aviators in the country, and it was sound and
      true in every part. Peggy felt no fear of anything giving out
      under the strain.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now the aviation park appeared in the distance. Peggy
      headed straight for it, hoping devoutly that her motor would
      not heat up and jam under the terrific speed it was being
      forced to.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cuban woman glanced round anxiously. It was a bad move
      for her. Like a flash the <i>Golden Butterfly</i> shot by the
      other machine as the latter wobbled badly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peggy's delight was mixed with apprehension. The motor was
      beginning to smoke. Plainly it was heating up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will it last five minutes longer?"
    </p>
    <p>
      That was the thought in Peggy's mind. The <i>Golden
      Butterfly</i> was hardly an airship any longer. It was a
      thunderbolt&mdash;a flying arrow. Before Peggy's eyes there
      was nothing now but the tall red and white "pylon" that
      marked the winning post. Could she make it ahead of her
      rival? Close behind her she could hear the roar of the other
      motor, but she did not dare to look round for fear of losing
      ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Swiftly she mentally selected the spot where she would land,
      and then down shot the <i>Golden Butterfly</i> like a
      pouncing fish hawk. The speed of the descent fairly took
      Peggy's breath away. Her cap had come off and her golden hair
      streamed out in the breeze wildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a blur of flying trees, then came the grandstand, a
      mere smudge of color, a sea of dimly seen faces and a roar
      that was like that of a hundred waterfalls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down shot the <i>Golden Butterfly</i> just inside the
      "pylon." It ran for about a hundred yards and was then
      brought to a stop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peggy Prescott had won the great race.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXII.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      PEGGY'S GENEROSITY.
    </h3>
    <p>
      "Oh, Peggy, it's the proudest moment of my life!" cried
      Jimsy, as a shouting, excited crowd surrounded the
      a&euml;roplane in which Peggy still sat, feeling dazed and a
      little dizzy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you wonderful girl!" cried out Bess, half laughing and
      half crying; "gracious, what an exciting finish. I thought
      I'd go wild when it looked as if you weren't going to win."
    </p>
    <p>
      They helped her from the a&euml;roplane while policemen
      pushed the crowd back. Somebody brought a tray with steaming
      hot tea and crackers on it. But Peggy could not eat. She felt
      faint and dreamy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Brace up!" urged Jimsy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll be all right in a minute. It's the strain of those last
      few minutes. I never thought I'd win."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I never doubted it," declared Jess stoutly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wonder where Roy is?" asked Peggy anxiously, as they
      entered a box in the grandstand where they could be secluded
      from the shoving, curious, staring crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't know; but he's all right, depend upon it," said Jimsy
      cheerfully; "hello, what's that coming now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a homing a&euml;roplane."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, a minute later:
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's Roy. Look at him come. I didn't think the <i>Red
      Dragon</i> could go as fast."
    </p>
    <p>
      Roy it was, sure enough. He was coming at a pace that might
      have landed him as winner of the race if he had not been
      delayed by his errand of mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten minutes later he had joined them. First he explained what
      had happened to the judges of the course. Kelly, crest-fallen
      and wretched-looking, thanked him half heartedly for what he
      had done and said that he would care for Speedwell till he
      got better, which, by the way, was a promise that he did not
      perform.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sudden stir in the crowd caused the little party in the box
      to look up.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man was hastily chalking up some legend on the big black
      bulletin board. It ran thus:
    </p>
    <pre>
  Long-distance Race for $500 prize.
  Start of Flight&mdash;11:01:2.
  Finish of Flight&mdash;12:02:0.
  Maximum Height&mdash;1,500 feet.
  Wind Velocity&mdash;10 miles from southeast.
  Winner&mdash;<i>Golden Butterfly</i>.
  Winning Aviator&mdash;Miss Margaret Prescott.
</pre>
    <p>
      What a cheer went up then. It seemed as if the roof would be
      raised off the grandstand by it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's like a dream!" sighed Peggy, "just like a dream."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, don't get fainty, Peggy, or Miss Margaret Prescott,"
      admonished Jess; "as Jimsy says, 'brace up,' the best is yet
      to come."
    </p>
    <p>
      A man came up to where they were sitting. In his hand he had
      a slip of pink paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roy reached out for it, but the man said that he had
      instructions to hand it only to Peggy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's the check for the prize-winning money," he explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peggy took it and sat gazing at it for a minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Peggy, what are you going to do with it?" asked Bess.
      "Buy some dresses or hats or&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "None of those things," said Peggy; "I made up my mind before
      I went into the race as to what I would do with the money if
      I won."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what's that?" asked Miss Prescott.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, it must go toward The Wren's education," rejoined the
      girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Peggy, you darling!" cried Jess, flinging her arms round
      her chum, in full view of the grandstand and the crowd below.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for The Wren, she gazed up at the girl with wide-open
      brown eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are too good to me&mdash;too good," she said simply; but
      there was a plaintive quiver in her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. James Parker sat on the porch of his home, in the
      foothills of the Big Smokies, gazing out over the landscape.
      Seemingly he was watching for something.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He done watch de sky lak he 'spected de bottom drap clean
      out uv it pretty soon," said Uncle Jupe, his factotum, to his
      wife Mandy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Gwan, you fool nigger, don' you know dat dem flying boys
      an' gals is to be hayr ter-day?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, dat's jes a joke, dat is," rejoined Uncle Jupe; "how's
      they all goin' ter fly ah'd lak to know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don' know, but dat's what Marse Parker says."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Den he's been grocersly imposed upon by somebody. Ain't
      likely dat ef de Lawd had meant us ter fly he'd have give us
      wings, wouldn't he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go 'long, now, Don' flossyfying roun' hyar. You git out an'
      hoe dat cohn. Look libely, now. You git it done fo' dinner or
      dere'll be trouble."
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Jupe shuffled out of the kitchen, but in a minute he
      came rushing back.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wha' de matter?" demanded his wife, noticing his wildly
      staring eyes and open mouth; "you gone fool crazy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "M-m-m-m-mandy, it's true! It's true!" gasped Uncle Jupe.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wha's true,&mdash;dat you all's crazy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;no, it's 'bout dem flyin' things. Dey's comin'.
      Come and look wid your own eyes."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mandy shuffled out. There, sure enough, coming toward them,
      was a flock of what at first sight appeared to be immense
      birds. But it was the young sky cruisers nearing their
      destination.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the porch Mr. Parker stood up and waved his newspaper. Ten
      minutes later the a&euml;roplanes came to earth in the smooth
      front lawn, while Uncle Jupe restrained a strong inclination
      to run away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dey ain't canny, dem things," he declared; "ef de Lord had
      wanted us to fly he'd have given us wings, I guess.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir, he'd sure have given us wings des de same as
      angels hev," he repeated musingly.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIII.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE MOONSHINERS AND THE A&Euml;ROPLANE.
    </h3>
    <p>
      "This is a beautiful country, sis."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, indeed," agreed Peggy warmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two were flying high above the romantic scenery of the
      Big Smoke Mountains of North Carolina in the <i>Golden
      Butterfly</i>. Beneath them lay a wild-looking expanse of
      country,&mdash;peaks, deep ca&ntilde;ons and cliffs heavily
      wooded and here and there bare patches cropping out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let's drop down on one of those patches and do some
      exploring," suggested Peggy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right," agreed Roy, nothing loath. The <i>Golden
      Butterfly</i> was headed downward.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes they landed on a smooth spot surrounded by
      trees. Leaving the a&euml;roplane, they struck off on a path
      through the woods. "Wonder if we can't find some
      huckleberries hereabouts," suggested Roy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes, lots. Wouldn't it be dandy to take home a bucketful
      by a&euml;roplane!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's a little hut off yonder, maybe we could get a bucket
      or something there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let's see if there are any berries first," said the
      practical Peggy.
    </p>
    <p>
      From out of the hut shuffled an old woman. She was a wrinkled
      and hideous old hag, brown as a seasoned meerschaum pipe and
      in her mouth was a reeking corn cob.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her feet were bare, and altogether she was a most repulsive
      old crone. She saw Roy and Peggy almost as soon as they saw
      her. For an instant she stood looking at them and then raised
      her voice in a sort of shrill shriek.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instantly from the woods around several men
      appeared&mdash;wild-looking, bearded fellows, each of whom
      carried a rifle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What you alls want hyar?" demanded one who seemed to be the
      leader.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We were just taking a walk," explained Roy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wa'al, we all don't like strangers particlar."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So it would seem," rejoined Roy, with a bold voice, although
      his heart was beating rather fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How'd you alls get hyar?" was the next question from the
      inquisitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We flew here," rejoined Roy truthfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the man's face grew black with wrath.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don' you alls lie to me; it ain't healthy," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not in the habit of doing so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you said you flew hyar."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, we did."
    </p>
    <p>
      "See hyar, young stranger, you jes' tell me the truth 'bout
      how you came or by the eternal I'll make it hot fer you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can only show you that I'm speaking nothing but the
      truth," rejoined the boy; "if you'll come with me I'll show
      you what we flew here in."
    </p>
    <p>
      The man glanced at him suspiciously. It was plain that he
      feared a trap of some sort. His eyes were wild and shifty as
      a wolf's.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ain't you frum the guv-ment?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know just what you mean."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I reckin that's jus' more dum' lyin'."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don' get sassy, young feller, it won't do you no good. But
      I'll come with you. Come on, boys, we'll take a look at this
      flyin' thing. I reckon that even if it is a trap there's
      enough of us to take care of a pack of them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's right, Jeb," agreed the men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of them, who had been hanging back in the bushes, now
      came forward. They were all as wild-looking as their leader,
      Jeb. The old woman mumbled and talked to herself as they
      strode off behind Roy and Peggy.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was one of the strangest adventures of their lives and
      neither one of them could hit on any explanation of the
      hillmen's conduct.
    </p>
    <p>
      It did not take long to reach the a&euml;roplane, and Roy
      turned triumphantly to Jeb.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," he said, "what do you think now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wa'al, it ain't flyin', is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course not, but I can make it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You kin?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Flap its wings and all that like a burd?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, it doesn't flap its wings."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then how kin it fly?" propounded Jeb.
    </p>
    <p>
      A murmur of approval ran through the throng. Jeb's logic
      appealed to their primitive intellects.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing can't fly that don't flap its wings," said one of
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But if it didn't fly, how in tarnation did it git here?"
      asked an old man with a grizzled beard and blackened stumps
      of teeth projecting from shrunken gums.
    </p>
    <p>
      This appeared to be a poser for even Jeb. He had nothing to
      say.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you like I'll give you a ride in it," proffered Roy to
      Jeb.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right; only no monkey tricks now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wa'al, in course I know it won't fly, but if it does you'll
      hev to let me out."
    </p>
    <p>
      With this sage remark Jeb stepped gingerly into the chassis
      of the a&euml;roplane. He sat down where he was told and Roy
      took the wheel. Jeb's companions gazed on in awed silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look out, Jeb," cried one.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't hit the sky," yelled another.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bring me back a star," howled the facetious old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Me a bit of the moon," called another.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeb said nothing to this raillery. Instead, he looked
      uneasily about him and held his rifle, which he had insisted
      on bringing with him, between his knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right?" asked Roy, looking back at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As right as I ever will be," rejoined Jeb, with a rather
      sickly grin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must hold tight," warned Peggy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm doing that," said Jeb.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then with the same sickly grin:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say, miss, does it really fly?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course it does. As that old man said, how could it have
      got here if it didn't."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I guess I'd better go home and git my coat," said Jeb,
      trying to climb out.
    </p>
    <p>
      His demeanor had completely changed since he had climbed into
      the chassis. Something in its well-cushioned seats and the
      sight of the powerful engine and propeller seemed to have
      changed his mind about the capabilities of the <i>Golden
      Butterfly</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was too late. With a roar the engine started.
      Instantly the little plateau was deserted. The mountaineers
      were all behind trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeb rushed for the side of the car.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sit down!" screeched Peggy, really fearing he would fall
      over.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if Jeb's intention had been to climb out it was foiled.

    <p>
      "Too late now," shouted Roy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The a&euml;roplane shot upward, carrying as a passenger a man
      temporarily crazy from fright.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Roy felt the muzzle of a rifle press against the
      back of his neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take me back to earth er I'll shoot," said a voice in his
      ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roy obeyed, and so ended Jeb's first a&euml;roplane ride. It
      may be added that it was also his last.

    <h3>
      MR. PARKER'S STORY.
    </h3>
    <p>
      "It was a gang of moonshiners that you stumbled across," said
      Mr. Parker, when they told him of their adventure; "you were
      fortunate to escape as you did."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I guess we have that a&euml;roplane ride we gave to Jeb to
      thank for that," laughed Roy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It wasn't so laughable, though, when he pressed that rifle
      to your neck," declared Peggy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, indeed. That was a mighty uncomfortable feeling, I can
      tell you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It reminds me of an experience I had with moonshiners once,"
      said Mr. Parker. "Would you care to hear about it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course they would. They were sitting on the porch in the
      twilight after dinner. It was a happy group and they had been
      exploding with laughter over Roy's account of Jeb's ride.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was a good many years ago, when I was in the employ of
      the government," said Mr. Parker, "that what I am going to
      tell you about happened. I was a young fellow then, and a
      good bit of a dare-devil, so I was sent at the head of a body
      of men to rout out moonshiners.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As you may know from your experience this morning, it is
      mighty dangerous to be suspected of being in the employ of
      the government, and so we posed as drummers and peddlers,
      scattering through the mountains.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Each of us worked alone so as not to attract attention. Our
      job was merely to locate the illicit stills and then militia
      would be sent to raid and destroy them, and the vile stuff
      they concoct.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had been on the job about a week when I came one night to
      a desolate-looking little shack on a high mountainside. It
      did not look inviting, but I had to have shelter for the
      night, so I stepped to the door and knocked. A rather comely
      looking woman replied to my summons.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I'm a peddler,' I explained, 'could I get something to eat
      and a room here for the night?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "She looked at me twice before answering.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'What you tradin' in?' she asked, with a trace of suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I judged from her manner that there was an illicit still in
      the neighborhood and that was what made her so suspicious.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Oh, laces, ribbons and so forth,' I replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I showed her some samples.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll give you breakfast, supper and a bed fer that bit of
      red ribbon,' she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I'll throw in this bit of blue,' said I gallantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And so the bargain was struck. It was a small place, but
      neat and tidy. Two children were playing about and in a
      corner sat a man trying to read a month-old newspaper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pop, this feller traded in these bits of ribbon fer bed and
      two meals,' she said, proudly exhibiting her goods and
      evidently thinking she had made an excellent bargain. I could
      see the gleam of triumph in her eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Humph!' grunted the man, 'much good those are.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then he turned to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Peddler?' he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Yes,' said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'What you tradin' in?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Oh, silks, laces and so forth,' rejoined I, repeating my
      formula.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Humph!'
    </p>
    <p>
      "He looked at me, narrowing his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'You don't look much like a peddler," said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'No, I've seen better days,' I said, with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I could see that he was still suspicious.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Where'd you come from?' was his next question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'South,' said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Where you going?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'North.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Ain't much on conversation, be yer?' he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'No, I'm not considered a very talkative fellow,' I
      rejoined.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We lapsed into silence. The man smoked. I just sat and
      thought the situation over. At last supper was announced. It
      was eaten almost in silence. The man discouraged all his
      wife's efforts at conversation. He was sullen and nervous.
    </p>
    <p>
      "More than ever did I begin to suspect that there was a still
      in the immediate neighborhood. Soon after supper I pleaded
      fatigue and was shown up a flight of stairs, or rather a
      ladder, to a sort of attic. There was a husk mattress there,
      and a pile of rather dirty-looking blankets. But in those
      hills you learn to put up with what you can get. I was glad
      to have found shelter at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But tired as I was for some reason I couldn't sleep. I felt
      a sort of vague uneasiness. I heard the man get up and go out
      and then later on I heard several voices downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There were broad chinks in the floor, and through these I
      could look down. The men&mdash;there were four of
      them&mdash;were talking in low voices, but now and then I
      could catch a word. All of a sudden I heard one say something
      about government spy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That gave me a shock, I can tell you. I knew then they were
      talking about me. My predicament was a bad one if they
      suspected me. I began to look about me for a way to get out.
      While doing this I occasionally looked down below.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The last time I looked I got a shock that made my hair
      stand. The fellows were moving about the room. From one
      corner one of them got a formidable-looking knife.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Scared to death, I redoubled my efforts to find a way out.
      At last at one end of the room I found a chimney, one of
      those big stone affairs as big as all outdoors. I decided to
      try this.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I found that it was rough inside, and I had not much
      difficulty in clambering up it. I was near the top when I
      heard a voice from the room below say:
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Then we uns 'ull kill him right now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Yep, he's lived long enough. He's no good.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "My heart jumped into my mouth. I redoubled my efforts and
      emerged from the top of the chimney. Reaching it, I lowered
      myself to the roof as gently as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The eaves came down low to the ground and I had not much
      difficulty in making my escape noiselessly."

    <h3>
      THE WREN DISAPPEARS.
    </h3>
    <p>
      "But as I reached the ground a startling thing happened. I
      missed my footing and found myself rolling down a steepish
      bank. At the bottom I fetched up against an odd-looking
      little hut almost overgrown with bushes. It was bright
      moonlight and the door was open.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Inside was a fire, and by its light I could see that the
      place was empty of human life, but that a collection of
      objects already familiar to me almost filled it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was an illicit still!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Clearly enough, also, it was operated by my hosts up above.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I listened for sounds of pursuit, but heard none. Possibly
      they had not yet crept into my room to perform their horrible
      resolve.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Suddenly the silence was broken by appalling yells and
      screams. My hair bristled for an instant and then I burst
      into a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was a pig that I heard. At the same instant it dawned on
      me that it was the pig that they had been discussing
      dispatching and not me at all. You can imagine the revulsion
      of my feelings. But I felt sore at the scare they had given
      me, so I decided to do some work for the government and even
      up scores at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Entering the shack, I scattered the coals of the fire right
      and left. Then I came away. No, I did <i>not</i> go back to
      the cabin. It would, as your friend Jeb said, not have been
      healthy for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Instead I set off running at top speed through the woods.
      Before long I saw a glow on the sky behind me, and knew that
      flames were devouring the vile stuff that moonshiners make.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I left my pack behind me, however, and I hope that
      compensated them for the loss of their still. I'm sure the
      woman, at any rate, would value its contents more highly."
    </p>
    <p>
      They all burst into a laugh at the conclusion of Mr. Parker's
      odd story. They were still laughing when Mandy rushed out on
      the porch.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Wren done be gone!" she shouted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gone!" they all echoed, in dismayed tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. I done go to her room to see de poo' lamb is com'foble,
      and she not there. I done find dis writin', too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me look at it," demanded Mr. Parker.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It mighty hard to read. It sure is a scan-lous bit of
      writin'."
    </p>
    <p>
      With this comment the colored woman handed over to her master
      a bit of dirty wrapping paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      On it was scrawled in almost illegible characters:
    </p>
    <p>
      "U wont git hur agin.&mdash;The Romanys."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Romanys!" exclaimed Peggy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; that's the gipsy word for themselves," said Mr. Parker.
      "I'm afraid that the same band that had her before has stolen
      her again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are we to do?" wailed Bess.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hush!" said Jess; "let Mr. Parker decide what is best."
    </p>
    <p>
      They stood about with dismayed faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Prescott was weeping softly. Peggy could hardly keep
      back her tears. The little brown Wren had become very dear to
      all of them. It was a hard blow indeed to lose her like this.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But how could they know that she was here?" objected Jimsy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, that silly newspaper report that went out when you
      arrived here about your adventures on the way and the
      romantic rescue of Wren. If they had come across that it
      would have given them a clew."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They were traveling south then, Wren said, and that was two
      weeks ago. They would have had ample time to reach this
      vicinity."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is so," rejoined Mr. Parker solemnly; "I'll make
      telephonic inquiries at once. They may have been seen in the
      vicinity."
    </p>
    <p>
      "While you are doing that we'll examine the room. They may
      have left a clew there," said Roy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roy and Jimsy darted upstairs on this errand. On looking
      round the place it was clear enough how the abductors had
      gotten in. Outside the window was an extension roof. It would
      have been very easy for an active man such as gipsies usually
      are to have clambered in and out again without detection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking a lantern they examined the ground outside. On a
      flower bed below the roof was the imprint of a man's feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Notice anything peculiar about it?" asked Jimsy, for Roy was
      bending earnestly over the prints.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I'd know that foot print again anywhere," he said;
      "see, one side of the man's boot was broken, the one of the
      right foot. His toes show here on the ground."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That might be a good clew if it was daylight; but right
      now&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimsy sighed. It was manifestly impossible to do any tracking
      of the man with the broken boot in the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'll have to wait till daylight."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, bother it all. They may be miles away by that time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I doubt it. I wouldn't wonder if they hide right around
      here. There are lots of good places, and they know that the
      hue and cry will be so hot that they would be caught if they
      traveled."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's so. Maybe we can find them, after all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let's hope so. Well, we can do no more good here. Let's go
      in."
    </p>
    <p>
      Peggy met them at the door. She seemed wildly excited over
      something.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The mail rider's just been here," she exclaimed, "and listen
      to this letter. It's from a woman living near New York. She
      just got back from Europe and in an old newspaper she read an
      account of our sky cruise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is certain that The Wren is her daughter and gives a
      description of her that tallies in every particular. She said
      that Wren was caught out in a heavy thunderstorm and sought
      refuge in a gipsy camp, as she learned afterward from a
      farmer who had seen her. She hunted high and low but has
      never since had word of the child. Her right name is Sylvia
      Harvey. Mrs. James Harvey is her mother, and she's rushing
      here as fast as a train will carry her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If it is really Sylvia Harvey then her mother has found her
      only to lose her again," sighed Jess.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't say that," said Mr. Parker, coming into the room at
      that moment, "we'll leave no stone unturned to find her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you have any success with the telephone?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; nobody has seen a band of people answering to the
      descriptions you gave of The Wren's abductors."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then we can do nothing more?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The question came from Roy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not to-night. It would be useless. I have notified all the
      police around and a general alarm will be sent out at once.
      And now I order every one to bed. We've hard work in front of
      us tomorrow."

      CHAPTER XXVI.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      CAPTURED BY GIPSIES.
    </h3>
    <p>
      About noon the next day Roy and Jimsy found themselves at the
      edge of a wild-looking section of country. They were standing
      at the entrance to a glen densely wooded with dark,
      forbidding-looking trees, and walled by precipitous and
      rugged rocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Looks as if the trail ends here," said Jimsy disconsolately.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It sure does. We can't&mdash;&mdash;Gee, Whillikens!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What on earth is up now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's the broken-toed boot. Look here on the muddy bank of
      this little stream."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By hooky, it is! We've struck the trail instead of ending
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What will we do; go back for re&euml;nforcements?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not just yet. We'll reconnoiter a bit. See, the fellow went
      up this bank and&mdash;look there, Jimsy&mdash;there's a
      little footprint beside. He was dragging the child along."
    </p>
    <p>
      With beating hearts the two boys entered the
      forbidding-looking glen. It was almost dark under the trees,
      which made the aspect of the place even more gloomy and
      desolate looking.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is a nice, cheerful sort of place," said Jimsy, in a
      low tone, as they walked along, following the bank of the
      stream, for the brush was too thick to admit of their walking
      anywhere else, which is what had driven the broken-booted man
      to leave a tell-tale trail behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I rather wish I had a gun," said Jimsy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We won't get close enough to them to need it," rejoined Roy;
      "we'll just spy out their hiding place and then go back for
      re&euml;nforcements."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's the best idea. I don't much fancy a hand-to-hand
      encounter with a band of such desperate ruffians as those
      gipsies have shown themselves to be."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't be scared. We won't have any trouble if we're
      careful."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not scared; but if we did get in a tussle with them they
      could easily overpower us and then we'd have done more harm
      than good for they'd take fright and move right off."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's my idea. We'll be as cautious as mousing cats."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Better stop talking, then. I never heard a mousing cat
      mi-ouw."
    </p>
    <p>
      Cautiously they crept on. The trail still held good. At last
      they reached the head of the glen where a spring showed the
      source of the brook.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What next?" whispered Jimsy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let's see if we can find which way that fellow went. The
      ground is spongy all around here and&mdash;ah! this way! See
      it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimsy nodded. They struck off to the right, clambering over
      rocks till they reached the summit of a small hill. A tall
      dead tree stood there and Jimsy volunteered to climb it in
      order to spy out the surrounding country for traces of the
      gipsys. But on his return to the ground he was compelled to
      admit that they had gained nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought I might see some smoke that would give me a clew
      to their whereabouts," he explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not much chance of their being as foolish as that. I guess
      they know searching parties are out all over by this time,
      and they are too foxy to light fires."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I might have thought of that," admitted Jimsy; "it would be
      about the last thing they would do. What will we do now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hardly know. Hello! there's an odd-looking place. Right
      over there. See that deep ca&ntilde;on? That one with the
      fallen tree across it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I do now. Let's look over there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right. You're on."
    </p>
    <p>
      The two boys struck off in the direction of Roy's discovery.
      It was indeed an odd freak of nature. Some convulsion of the
      earth had detached quite a section of land from the
      surrounding country. It was, in fact, an island in the midst
      of the woods with only the fallen tree for a bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let's cross it and examine the place," suggested Roy, with
      all a boy's curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Together they crossed the old tree, which had evidently
      fallen there by accident, although, in reality, it formed a
      perfect bridge. The "island" was thickly wooded and they
      pushed forward across it, not without some difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly they came upon a sight that made them halt dead in
      their tracks.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man holding a rifle was sitting on a fallen log. The
      instant he saw them he raised his weapon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't come no further," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not?" demanded Roy indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "See that sign?" said the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pointed to a rudely painted sign on a tree at his back.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dangir. No Trespasin."
    </p>
    <p>
      That was what it said in bold letters that sprawled across
      its surface in an untidy fashion. The execution of the thing
      was as bad as its spelling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I guess a pretty sick man painted that sign," grinned Jimsy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean?" was the surly reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, I should judge he was having an awful bad spell at the
      time," was the boy's rejoinder.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man scowled at him fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No joking round here," he growled; "now, then, if you know
      what's good for you you two kids will vamoose."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's the danger if we keep on?" asked Roy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, they're trying a new kind of explosive back there. It
      might go off the wrong way, your way, for instance, and hurt
      you," was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Seems a funny sort of place to try out explosives," said
      Roy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Seems a queer sort of place for you two kids to come. Who
      are you, anyhow?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, we are camping down below and we just came out for a
      stroll."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, stroll some other place, then. Git away from round
      here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We certainly will," flashed back Roy; "come on, Jimsy."
    </p>
    <p>
      As there seemed nothing else to do Jimsy agreed. They turned
      away and began retracing their steps, no wiser as to the
      whereabouts of the man with the broken boot than they had
      been when they set out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as they turned to go, however, another man came out of
      the woods behind the man with the rifle. When he saw the boys
      he gave an abrupt start.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where did those boys come from?" he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know. Said they was two kids out campin' and takin'
      a stroll."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Taking a stroll, eh?" said the other ferociously; "they were
      taking a stroll looking for that Wren."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do you know?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because they are the same two kids who stole her from us
      just as we were going to demand a ransom for her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That was before I joined the band. No wonder I didn't know
      them; if I had&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      He scowled vindictively.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, we can't let 'em get away. Here, give me that rifle,"
      demanded the newcomer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other handed it to him. The next instant a report rang
      out and a bullet whizzed over the boys' heads.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come back here," shouted the man who had fired the shot; "I
      want to see you."
    </p>
    <p>
      The boys hesitated for a minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The next shot 'ull come lower if you don't," warned the man;
      "come on, no nonsense."
    </p>
    <p>
      As there seemed to be nothing else to do the boys obeyed. As
      they drew closer they recognized the fellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you know me, eh?" he snarled; "well, you'll know me
      better before we get through. Follow me, now. Pedro, you take
      the rifle and fall in behind. If they try to escape shoot
      them down."
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was a fine situation. They had found the gipsies' camp
      with a vengeance, but for all the good it was going to do The
      Wren, unless they could get her away, they might as well not
      have come. These gloomy reflections sifted through their
      minds as they paced along, the man with the rifle
      occasionally prodding them with it just to make them "step
      lively," as he phrased it.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length they came to a sort of large open place shaped like
      a basin, and placed in the middle of this natural island. In
      this basin were set up several squalid tents, about which the
      gipsies were squatting.
    </p>
    <p>
      They set up a yell of surprise as the two boys were brought
      in.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where under the sun did you find them, Beppo?" exclaimed the
      same woman who had so cruelly ill-treated The Wren the time
      the boys rescued her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, they were just taking a stroll, and happened to stroll
      in here," said Beppo viciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I guess they won't have a chance to bother us again. They're
      going to make quite a stay here."
    </p>
    <p>
      The gipsies set up a taunting laugh. Suddenly, from one of
      the tents, a tiny figure darted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I knew you'd come! I knew you'd come," it cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the poor little Wren. She had been stripped of her
      nice clothes and put into some filthy rags, her face was
      stained with crying and there was a bruise on her forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a curse Beppo seized the child by one arm, swung her
      round and dealt her a savage box on the ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Get back where you belong!" he roared.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next instant Beppo had measured his length on the ground
      and beneath one of his eyes a beautiful plum-colored swelling
      was developing. As has been said, Roy could hit a powerful
      blow.

      CHAPTER XXVII.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      DELIVERANCE.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The next minute all was wild confusion. The boys found
      themselves on the ground, being scratched and bitten and
      kicked by men and women alike. They did not have a chance
      against this horde of half savage wanderers. At length beaten
      and bruised they were tied with ropes and thrown into one of
      the tents and a man set to guard it.
    </p>
    <p>
      All day they lay there without anything to eat or drink and
      no one to come near them except that occasionally a tangled
      head would be thrust in to hurl some taunt at them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Darkness fell and they still lay there, suffering terrible
      pain from their wounds and bonds.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is the uttermost limit," declared Roy, in a low tone;
      "we're in the worst fix we ever got into this time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We certainly are. What a bit of bad luck that the rascal
      Beppo came up when he did! That other gipsy had no idea who
      we were."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I had the satisfaction of giving Master Beppo a good
      black eye," muttered Roy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; that was a peach. It did me good to see it land."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It landed all right. Ouch, my back feels as if it was
      broken."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My wrists and ankles are awfully sore. I wonder if they mean
      to let us loose or give us anything to eat."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, we won't last long at this rate. I guess they mean to
      be as cruel as they can to us in return for that punch I gave
      Beppo."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wouldn't have spoken to you again if you hadn't."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't blame you."
    </p>
    <p>
      It grew dark. Outside they heard the murmur of voices for a
      time and then all became quiet. Just before silence fell and
      snores became audible they heard the man on duty as their
      guard call for some coffee to keep by his side during the
      night.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll send that brat of a Wren to you with it directly," they
      heard Beppo's wife reply; "the little beast, it'll do her
      good to work."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came the sound of a slap and a sob.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boys' blood boiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, what wouldn't I give to have Master Beppo in a
      twenty-four-foot ring," breathed Roy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think he'd look well decorating a tree," grated out Jimsy
      viciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night wore on, but the boys did not sleep. Their tight
      bonds and worry over their situation prevented this.
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once Roy's attention was attracted by somebody raising
      the flap at the back of the tent. Next something crawled in.
      At first he thought it was a large dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      But then came a whisper:
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's me, Wren."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you doing here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hush, I've come to get you free. You'll take me with you,
      won't you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course; what a question to ask! But how can you free us?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've got a knife here. I'll cut those ropes in a minute."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But the guard outside?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've fixed him. Was it very wrong of me? While Mother Beppo
      wasn't looking I put some of the stuff in that coffee I
      brought him."
    </p>

      "'I'd do anything for you.' said the child, as she rapidly cut the ropes.">
      </center>
    <p>
      "Well, upon my word, Wren! What sort of stuff?" gasped Jimsy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, some sort of brown stuff. I've seen Mother Beppo smoke
      it. It makes her oh so sleepy. So I gave some to him and he's
      sound asleep now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Must have been opium," declared Roy. "Wren, do you know that
      you are a very bad young lady?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd do anything for you. You're so good and kind to me,"
      said the child, as she rapidly cut the ropes.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a time the boys, after being freed, just lay there,
      unable to move. But after a while circulation set in and they
      began to move their limbs. In half an hour the trio crept out
      of the tent and, crossing the "island," traversed the trunk
      bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait a minute," said Roy, when they reached the other side.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you going to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Make that whole outfit prisoners till the officers of the
      law can get up here."
    </p>
    <p>
      He took a broken branch as a lever and with Jimsy's
      assistance toppled the log down into the ca&ntilde;on.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now I guess they'll stay put for a while," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      And they did. That was why, when a posse came up to capture
      the band, they carried materials for building a bridge across
      the ca&ntilde;on. It may as well be said here that the band
      received heavy sentences, it being proved at their trial that
      they had made a practice of kidnapping children and then
      trying to collect ransoms for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a happy scene next day at the Parker home when Mrs.
      Harvey, a sweet-faced woman of middle age, arrived. After one
      look at Wren she swayed and then, recovering herself, called
      out in the voice that only a mother knows:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sylvia!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mother!" screamed the child, and rushed into her open arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tide of memory, driven to low ebb by ill-treatment and
      hardship, had rushed back with full force. The Wren, the
      gipsy waif, was once more Sylvia Harvey. A doctor said later
      that such cases were frequent following a severe shock. It
      was then that they recalled how the child had almost
      recollected some of her past life during the thunderstorm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The happiness of little Wren and her mother in their reunion
      was shared by all of the party who had been instrumental in
      effecting it, for every one of them, including Jake, had
      become attached to the quiet little girl and rejoiced in her
      good fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mrs. Harvey and Sylvia departed for the railway station
      the following day behind a pair of Mr. Parker's steady horses
      they were accompanied by the four a&euml;roplanes, which
      hovered over them like so many sturdy guardian angels.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when the train bore them away they watched the returning
      a&euml;rial escort until there was nothing visible but four
      tiny dots against the blue heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, mother," exclaimed Wren, "they look no bigger than
      butterflies now!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And the Girl Aviators, flying every moment higher and farther
      on the powerful wings of the <i>Golden Butterfly</i> and the
      delicate plane of the dainty <i>Dart</i>, looked back at the
      train crawling like a humble insect in the valley below and
      gloried in their untrammeled flight. As they followed Roy and
      Jimsy in an irregular procession through the air, their
      thoughts flew ahead, outdistancing the biplane and the <i>Red
      Dragon</i> and speeding confidently toward the happy
      realizations of the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Prescott, watching from the home of Mr. Parker for their
      return, also dreamed dreams and saw visions, and in them her
      "dear children" were fulfilling the bright prophecies of the
      present. She saw them stronger because of adversity, braver
      because of success, and ennobled by all their experiences;
      and she deemed herself happy in her capacity of chaperon to
      the Girl Aviators.

    <p>
      A book which treats, in a most practical and fascinating
      manner all subjects pertaining to the "King of Trades";
      showing the care and use of tools; drawing; designing, and
      the laying out of work; the principles involved in the
      building of various kinds of structures, and the rudiments of
      architecture. It contains over two hundred and fifty
      illustrations made especially for this work, and includes
      also a complete glossary of the technical terms used in the
      art. The most comprehensive volume on this subject ever
      published for boys.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Electricity for Boys</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The author has adopted the unique plan of setting forth the
      fundamental principles in each phase of the science, and
      practically applying the work in the successive stages. It
      shows how the knowledge has been developed, and the reasons
      for the various phenomena, without using technical words so
      as to bring it within the compass of every boy. It has a
      complete glossary of terms, and is illustrated with two
      hundred original drawings.

    <p>
      This book takes the beginner through a comprehensive series
      of practical shop work, in which the uses of tools, and the
      structure and handling of shop machinery are set forth; how
      they are utilized to perform the work, and the manner in
      which all dimensional work is carried out. Every subject is
      illustrated, and model building explained. It contains a
      glossary which comprises a new system of cross references, a
      feature that will prove a welcome departure in explaining
      subjects. Fully illustrated.

Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in

the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
